<p class='c fs12'>A WORD</p>

<p>It is the vogue to dramatize successful novels. The author of the present
Nell Gwyn story has pursued the contrary course. His &#8220;merry&#8221; play of
the same name was written and produced before he undertook to compose this tale,
suggested by the same historic sources.</p>

<p>A word of tribute is gratefully given to the <i>comédienne</i>, Miss Crosman,
whose courage and exquisite art introduced the &#8220;Mistress Nell&#8221; of
the play to the public.</p>

<p>It was a merry time in merry old England; for King Charles II. was on the
throne.</p>

<p>Not that the wines were better or the ladies fairer in his day, but the
renaissance of carelessness and good-living had set in. True Roundheads again
sought quiet abodes in which to worship in their gray and sombre way. Cromwell,
their uncrowned king, was dead; and there was no place for his followers at
court or in tavern. Even the austere and Catholic smile of brother James of
York, one day to be the ruler of the land, could not cast a gloom over the
assemblies at Whitehall. There were those to laugh merrily at the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span> King&#8217;s wit, and at the
players&#8217; wit. There were those in abundance to enjoy to-day&#8211;to-day
only,&#8211;to drink to the glorious joys of to-day, with no care for the
morrow.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, merry old England; for, when the King has no cares, and
assumes no cares, the people likewise have no cares. The state may be rent, the
court a nest of intrigue, King and Parliament at odds, the treasury bankrupt:
but what care they; for the King cares not. Is not the day prosperous? Are not
the taverns in remotest London filled with roistering spirits who drink and sing
to their hearts&#8217; content of their deeds in the wars just done? Can they
not steal when hungry and demand when dry?</p>

<p>Aye, the worldly ones are cavaliers now&#8211;for a cavalier is
King&#8211;e&#8217;en though the sword once followed Cromwell and the gay cloak and
the big flying plume do not quite hide the not-yet-discarded cuirass of an
Ironside.</p>

<p>Cockpits and theatres! It is the Restoration! The maypole is up again at
Maypole<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span> Lane, and
the milk-maids bedecked with garlands dance to the tunes of the fiddle. Boys no
longer serve for heroines at the play, as was the misfortune in
Shakespeare&#8217;s day. The air is full of hilarity and joy.</p>

<p>Let us too for a little hour forget responsibility and fall in with the
spirit of the times; while we tipple and toast, and vainly boast: &#8220;The
King! Long live the King!&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Drury Lane was alive as the sun was setting, on the day of our visit to
London Town, with loungers and loafers; busy-bodies and hawkers; traffickers of
sweets and other petty wares; swaggering soldiers, roistering by, stopping
forsooth to throw kisses to inviting eyes at the windows above.</p>

<p>As we turn into Little Russell Street from the Lane, passing many chairs
richly made, awaiting their fair occupants, we come upon the main entrance to
the King&#8217;s House. Not an imposing or spacious structure to be sure, it
nevertheless was suited to the managerial purposes of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span> the day, which were, as now, to spend as
little and get as much as may be. The pit was barely protected from the weather
by a glazed cupola; so that the audience could not always hear the sweetest song
to a finish without a drenching, or dwell upon the shapeliness of the prettiest
ankle, that revealed itself in the dance by means of candles set on cressets,
which in those days sadly served the purposes of foot-lights.</p>

<p>It was Dryden&#8217;s night. His play was on&#8211;&#8220;The Conquest of
Granada.&#8221; The best of London were there; for a first night then was as
attractive as a first night now. In the balcony were draped boxes, in which
lovely gowns were seen&#8211;lovely hair and lovely gems; but the fair faces
were often masked.</p>

<p>The King sat listless in the royal box, watching the people and the play or
passing pretty compliments with the fair favourites by his side, diverted,
perchance, by the ill-begotten quarrel of some fellow with a saucy orange-wench
over the cost of her golden wares. The true gallants preferred being robbed to
haggling&#8211;for the shame of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>A knowing one in the
crowd was heard to say: &#8220;&#8216;Tis Castlemaine to the King&#8217;s
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;tis Madame Carwell; curse her,&#8221; snarled a more vulgar
companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame Querouaille, knave, Duchess of Portsmouth,&#8221; irritably
exclaimed a handsome gallant, himself stumbling somewhat over the French name,
though making a bold play for it, as he passed toward his box, pushing the
fellow aside. He added a moment later, but so that no one heard:
&#8220;Portsmouth is far from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the Duke of Buckingham&#8211;the great Duke of Buckingham, in the pit
of the King&#8217;s House! Truly, we see strange things in these strange times!
Indeed, William Penn himself did not hesitate to gossip with the orange-wenches,
unless Pepys lied&#8211;and Pepys never lied.</p>

<p>&#8220;What said he?&#8221; asked a stander-by, a butcher, who, with apron on
and sleeves to elbow, had hastily left his stall at one of the afternoon and
still stood with mouth agape and fingers widespread waiting for the play.
Before, however, his sooty companion <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_6'></a>6</span> could answer, they were jostled far apart.</p>

<p>The crowd struggled for places in eager expectation, amid banter none too
virtuous, whistlings and jostlings. The time for the play had arrived.
&#8220;Nell! Nell! Nell!&#8221; was on every lip.</p>

<p>And who was &#8220;Nell&#8221;?</p>

<p>From amidst the players, lords and coxcombs crowded on the stage stepped
forth Nell Gwyn&#8211;the prettiest rogue in merry England.</p>

<p>A cheer went up from every throat; for the little vixen who stood before them
had long reigned in the hearts of Drury Lane and the habitués of the
King&#8217;s House.</p>

<p>Yea, all eyes were upon the pretty, witty Nell; the one-time orange-girl; now
queen of the theatre, and the idol of the Lane. Her curls were flowing and her
big eyes dancing beneath a huge hat&#8211;more, indeed, a canopy than a
hat&#8211;so large that the audience screamed with delight at the incongruity of
it and the pretty face beneath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>This pace in foolery
had been set at the Duke&#8217;s House, but Nell out-did them, with her
broad-brimmed hat as large as a cart-wheel and her quaint waist-belt; for was
not her hat larger by half than that at the rival house and her waist-belt
quainter?</p>

<p>As she came forward to speak the prologue, her laugh too was merrier and more
roguish:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;This jest was first of the other house&#8217;s making,<br /> And,
five times tried, has never fail&#8217;d of taking;</i></p> </div><!-- poetry
-->

<p style='margin-left:10ex; letter-spacing:2em'>.......</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>This is that hat, whose very sight did win ye<br /> To laugh and clap as
though the devil were in ye,</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p style='margin-left:10ex; letter-spacing:2em'>.......</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>I&#8217;ll write a play, says one, for I have got<br /> A
broad-brimm&#8217;d hat, and waist-belt, towards a plot.<br /> Says the other,
I have one more large than that,<br /> Thus they out-write each other with a
hat!<br /> The brims still grew with every play they writ;<br /> And grew so
large, they cover&#8217;d all the wit.<br /> Hat was the play; &#8217;t was
language, wit, and tale:<br /> Like them that find meat, drink, and cloth in
ale.&#8220;</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>The King leaned well
out over the box-rail, his dark eyes intent upon Nell&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>A fair hand, however, was placed impatiently upon his shoulder and drew him
gently back. &#8220;Lest you fall, my liege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Castlemaine,&#8221; he replied, kindly but knowingly.
&#8220;You are always thoughtful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The play went on. The actors came and went. Hart appeared in Oriental robes
as Almanzor&#8211;a dress which mayhap had served its purposes for Othello, and
mayhap had not; for cast-off court-dresses, without regard to fitness, were the
players&#8217; favourite costumes in those days, the richness more than the
style mattering.</p>

<p>With mighty force, he read from the centre of the stage, with elocution true
and syllable precise, Dryden&#8217;s ponderous lines. The King nodded
approvingly to the poet. The poet glowed with pride at the patronage of the
King. The old-time audience were enchanted. Dryden sat with a triumphant smile
as he dwelt upon his poetic lines and heard the cherished syllables receive
rounds of applause from the Londoners.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>Was it the thought,
dear Dryden; or was it Nell&#8217;s pretty ways that bewitched the most of it?
Nell&#8217;s laugh still echoes in the world; but where are your plays, dear
Dryden?</p>

</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The greenroom of the King&#8217;s House was scarcely a prepossessing place or
inviting. A door led to the stage; another to the street. On the remaining doors
might have been deciphered from the Old English of a scene-artist&#8217;s daub
&#8220;Mistress Gwyn&#8221; and &#8220;Mr. Hart.&#8221; These doors led
respectively to the tiring-room of the sweet sprite who had but now set the pit
wild with a hat over a sparkling eye and to that of the actor-manager of the
House. A rough table, a few chairs, a mirror which had evidently seen better
days in some grand mansion and a large throne-chair which might equally well
have satisfied the royalty of Macbeth or Christopher Sly&#8211;its royalty,
forsooth, being in its size, for thus only could it lord-it over its
mates&#8211;stood in the corner. Old armour hung upon the wall, grim in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span> light of candles
fixed in braziers. Rushes were strewn about the floor.</p>

<p>Ah! Pepys, Pepys, was it here that you recalled &#8220;specially kissing of
Nell&#8221;? Mayhap; for we read in your book: &#8220;I kissed her, and so did
my wife, and a mighty pretty soul she is.&#8221; Be that as it may, however, you
must have found Nell&#8217;s lips very agreeable; for a great wit has suggested
that it was well that Mrs. Pepys was present on the occasion.</p>

<p>On great play-nights, however, this most unroyal room assumed the proportions
of royalty. Gallants and even lords sought entrance here and elbowed their way
about; and none dared say them nay. They forced a way even upon the stage during
the play, though not so commonly as before the Restoration, yet still too much;
and the players played as best they could, and where best they could.
<i>Billets-doux</i> passed, sweet words were said,&#8211;all in this
dilapidated, unpretentious, candle-lighted room.</p>

<p>At the moment of which we speak, the greenroom was deserted save for a lad of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span> twelve or fourteen
years, who stood before the mirror, posing to his personal satisfaction and
occasionally delivering bits from &#8220;Hamlet.&#8221; He was none other than
&#8220;Dick,&#8221; the call-boy of the King&#8217;s House.</p>

<p>The lad struck a final attitude, his brow clouded. He assumed what seemed to
him the proper pose for the royal Dane. His meditations and his pose, however,
were broken in upon by the sudden entrance of Manager Hart, flushed and in an
unusual state of excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my dagger, Dick?&#8221; he exclaimed, pacing the room.</p>

<p>The boy came to himself but slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing? Get my dagger, boy,&#8221; wildly reiterated the
irate manager. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see there will be a stage-wait?&#8221; He
cast an anxious glance in the direction of the door which led to the stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you leave it, sir?&#8221; asked the lad, finally realizing
that it would be wise not to trifle at such a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind where I left it. Get it, get it; do you hear! Nell&#8217;s
on the stage <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
already.&#8221; Hart rushed to the door and looked off in an increasing state of
excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ve got your dagger on, sir,&#8221; hesitatingly
suggested the lad, as he caught the gleam of a small scimiter among the folds of
Almanzor&#8217;s tunic.</p>

<p>Hart&#8217;s face flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devil take you, boy,&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;you are too stupid
ever to make an actor!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this speech, the manager strode out of the greenroom toward the
stage.</p>

<p>Poor Dick sank back in an attitude of resignation. &#8220;How long, O Rome,
must I endure this bondage?&#8221; he said, sadly.</p>

<p>He again observed his boyish figure in the mirror, and the pretty face
brightened as he realized that there might still be hope in life, despite
Manager Hart&#8217;s assertion that he would never be able to act. His features
slowly sank into a set expression of tremendous gloom, such as he thought should
characterize his conception of himself as Hamlet when in days to come the
mantles of Burbage and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_14'></a>14</span> of Betterton should be his and Manager Hart must bow
to him. He stood transfixed before the glass in a day-dream, forgetful of his
ills. His pretty lips moved, and one close by might have heard again, &#8220;To
be or not to be&#8221; in well-modulated phrase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, boy; here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick started.</p>

<p>It was a richly dressed gallant, in old-rose with royal orders, who had
entered the room quietly but authoritatively from the street&#8211;the same
lordly personage we observed in the pit. His manner was that of one accustomed
to be obeyed and quickly too. The lad knew him and bowed low.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Mistress Nell, Buckingham would speak with her. Lively, lad;
lively,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is on the stage, my lord,&#8221; replied Dick, respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad, I thought otherwise and stepped about from my box. Here; put
these flowers in her tiring-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy took the beautiful bouquet <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_15'></a>15</span> of white roses. &#8220;Yes, my lord,&#8221; he
replied, and turned to do the bidding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flowers strewn in ladies&#8217; ways oft&#8217; lead to princely
favours,&#8221; muttered his lordship, thoughtfully, as he removed his gloves
and vainly adjusted his hat and sword. &#8220;Portsmouth at Dover told me
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was apparent from his face that much passed before his mind, in that
little second, of days when, at Dover Castle not long since, he had been a
part&#8211;and no small part&#8211;of the intrigue well planned by Louis of
France, and well executed by the Duchess of Orléans assisted by the fair Louise,
now Duchess of Portsmouth, in which his own purse and power had waxed mightily.
Whatever his lordship thought, however, it was gone like the panorama before a
drowning brain.</p>

<p>He stopped the lad as he was entering Nell&#8217;s tiring-room, with an
exclamation. The boy returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave Mistress Nell my note bidding her to supper?&#8221; he asked,
questioningly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>&#8220;I did, my
lord,&#8221; answered Dick.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sheart, a madrigal worthy of Bacchus! She smiled delightedly?&#8221;
continued his lordship, in a jocular mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my lord; quite serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>His lordship&#8217;s face changed slightly. &#8220;Read it eagerly?&#8221; he
ventured, where he might have commanded, further to draw out the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my lord,&#8221; added Dick, respectfully, &#8220;after a
time.&#8221; The boy&#8217;s lids dropped to avoid revealing his amused
recollection of the incident; and his lordship&#8217;s quick eye noted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he exclaimed, with an assumed triumphant air. &#8220;She
folded it carefully and placed it in her bosom next her heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She threw it on the floor, my lord!&#8221; meekly answered Dick,
hiding his face in the flowers to avoid revealing disrespect.</p>

<p>&#8220;My <i>billet-doux</i> upon the floor!&#8221; angrily exclaimed his
lordship. &#8220;Plague on&#8217;t, she said something, made some answer,
boy?&#8221; The diplomat was growing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_17'></a>17</span> earnest despite himself, as diplomats often do in the
cause of women.</p>

<p>Dick trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said your dinners made amends for your company, my lord,&#8221; he
said, meekly.</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s eyes snapped; but he was too clever to reveal his feelings
further to a call-boy, whom he dismissed with a wave of the hand. He then
swaggered to the table and complacently exclaimed: &#8220;The rogue! Nelly,
Nelly, your lips shall pay tribute for that. Rosy impudence! Buckingham&#8217;s
dinners make amends for his company? Minx!&#8221; He threw himself into a chair,
filled with deep reflections of supper and wine, wit and beauty, rather than
state-craft.</p>

<p>Thus lost in selfish reflection, he did not observe, or, if he did, cared not
for, the frail figure and sweet face of one who cautiously tiptoed into the
greenroom. It was Orange Moll, whose sad countenance and tattered garments
betokened a sadder story. Her place was in the pit, with her back to the stage,
vending her <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span> oranges
to artisans, girls with vizards or foolish gallants. She had no right behind the
scenes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am &#8217;most afraid to enter here without Nell,&#8221; she thought,
faint-heartedly, as she glanced about the room and her eyes fell upon the great
Lord Buckingham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oranges? Will you have my oranges? Only sixpence, my lord,&#8221; she
ventured at length, then hesitatingly advanced and offered her wares; but his
lordship&#8217;s thoughts were far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we have for supper?&#8221; was his sole concern. &#8220;I
think Nelly would like spiced tongue.&#8221; Instantly his hands and eyes were
raised in mock invocation of the intervention of the Powers that Be, and so
suddenly that Moll drew back. &#8220;Ye Gods,&#8221; he exclaimed aloud,
&#8220;she has enough of that already! Ah, the vintage of&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was more habit than courage which brought to Moll&#8217;s trembling lips
the familiar orange-cry, which again interrupted him: &#8220;Oranges; only
sixpence. Here is one picked for you, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>Buckingham&#8217;s
eyes flashed with anger; he was not wont to have his way, much less his
pleasure, disturbed by the lowly. &#8220;Oh, hang you, you disturb me. I am
thinking; don&#8217;t you perceive I am thinking? Begone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only sixpence, my lord; I have not sold one to-night,&#8221; pleaded
the girl, sadly.</p>

<p>His lordship rose irritably. &#8220;I have no pauper&#8217;s pence,&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;Out of my way! Ragbag!&#8221; He pushed the girl roughly aside
and crossed the room.</p>

<p>At the same instant, there was confusion at the stage-door, the climax of
which was the re-entrance of Hart into the greenroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can a man play when he trembles for his life lest he step upon a
lord?&#8221; cried the angry manager. &#8220;They should be horsewhipped off the
stage, and&#8221;&#8211;his eyes falling upon Buckingham&#8211;&#8220;out of the
greenroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Hart,&#8221; began his lordship, with a patronizing air,
&#8220;why is Nelly so long? I desire to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart&#8217;s lips trembled, but he controlled <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span> his passion. &#8220;Indeed? His Majesty
and the good folk in front would doubtless gladly await your interview with
Mistress Eleanor Gwyn. Shall I announce your will, my lord, unto his Majesty and
stop the play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You grow ironical, friend Hart,&#8221; replied his lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said the actor, bowing low; &#8220;I am your
lordship&#8217;s most obedient servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s lip curled and his eyes revealed that he would have said
more, but the room was meantime filling with players from the stage, some
exchanging compliments, some strutting before the glass, and he would not so
degrade his dignity before them. Dick, foil in hand even in the manager&#8217;s
room, was testing the steel&#8217;s strength to his utmost, in boyish
fashion.</p>

<p>This confusion lent Moll courage, and forth came again the cry:
&#8220;Oranges? Will you have my oranges? Only sixpence, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>She boldly offered her wares to Almanzor, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_21'></a>21</span> but started and paled when the hero turned and
revealed Manager Hart.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, you little imp? Back to the pit, where you
belong.&#8221; The manager&#8217;s voice was full of meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell told me I might come here, sir,&#8221; said the girl, faintly
excusing herself.</p>

<p>Hart&#8217;s temper got the better of him. To admit before all that Nell
ruled the theatre was an affront to his managerial dignity which he could not
brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Nell did, did she?&#8221; he almost shrieked, as he angrily paced
the room like some caged beast, gesticulating wildly.</p>

<p>The actors gathered in groups and looked askant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gadso,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;who is manager, I should like to
know! Nell would introduce her whole trade here if she could. Every
orange-peddler in London will set up a stand in the greenroom at the
King&#8217;s, next we know. Out with you! This is a temple of art, not a
marketplace. Out with you!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>He seized Moll
roughly in his anger and almost hurled her out at the door. He would have done
so, indeed, had not Nell entered at this moment from the stage. Her eye caught
the situation at a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, blood, Iago, blood!&#8221; she exclaimed, mock-heroically, then
burst into the merriest laugh that one could care to hear. &#8220;How now, a
tragedy in the greenroom! What lamb is being sacrificed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart stood confused; the players whispered in expectation; and an amused
smile played upon the features of my Lord Buckingham at the manager&#8217;s
discomfiture. Finally Hart found his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old comrade of yours at orange-vending before you lost the art of
acting,&#8221; he suggested, with a glance at Moll.</p>

<p>&#8220;By association with you, Jack?&#8221; replied the witch of the theatre
in a way which bespoke more answers that wisdom best not bring forth.</p>

&#8220;ENEMIES TO THE KING&#8211;BEWARE!&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>Nell&#8217;s whole
heart went out to the subject of the controversy. Poor little tattered Orange
Moll! She was carried back in an instant to her own bitter life and bitter
struggles when an orange-girl. Throwing an arm about the child, she kissed away
the tears with, &#8220;What is the matter, dear Moll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all mocking me, and sent me back to the pit,&#8221; replied
the girl, hysterically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on you all,&#8221; said Nell; and the eyes that were so full of
comedy revealed tragic fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fy, fy,&#8221; pleaded Hart; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be charitable
to-morrow, Nell, after this strain is off&#8211;but a first
night&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need charity yourself?&#8221; suggested Nell; and she burst into a
merry laugh, in which many joined.</p>

<p>Buckingham instantly took up the gauntlet for a bold play, for a <i>coup
d&#8217;état</i> in flattery. &#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; he cried, waving aside the
players in a princely fashion. &#8220;When Nell plays, we have no time to munch
oranges. Let the wench bawl in the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Moll&#8217;s tears flowed again with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_24'></a>24</span> each harsh word. Nell was not so easily affected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odso, my lord! It is a pity your lordship is not a player. Then the
orange-trade would flourish,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Buckingham bowed, amused and curious. &#8220;Say you so, i&#8217; faith!
Pray, why, mad minx?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship would make such a good mark for the peel,&#8221;
retorted Nell, tossing a bit of orange-peel in his face, to the infinite delight
of Hart and his fellow-players.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devil!&#8221; angrily exclaimed his lordship as he realized the
insult. &#8220;I would kill a man for this; a woman, I can only love.&#8221; His
hand left his sword-hilt; and he bowed low to the vixen of the theatre, picked
from the floor the bit of peel which had fallen, kissed it, tossed it over his
shoulder and turned away.</p>

<p>Nell was not done, however; her revenge was incomplete. &#8220;There! dry
your eyes, Moll,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Give me your basket, child. You
shall be avenged still further.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>The greenroom had
now filled from the stage and the tiring-rooms; and all gathered gleefully about
to see what next the impish Nell would do, for avenged she would be they all
knew, though the course of her vengeance none could guess.</p>

<p>The manager, catching at the probable outcome when Nell seized from
Moll&#8217;s trembling arm the basket heaped with golden fruit, gave the first
warning: &#8220;Great Heavens! Flee for your lives! I&#8217;faith, here comes the
veteran robber at such traffic.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sudden rush for the stage, but Nell cried: &#8220;Guard the door,
Moll; don&#8217;t let a rascal out. I&#8217;ll do the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not Moll&#8217;s strength, however, which kept the greenroom filled,
but expectation of Nell. All gathered about with the suspense of a drama; for
Nell herself was a whole play as she stood in the centre of that little group of
lords and players, dressed for Almahyde, Dryden&#8217;s heroine, with a basket
of oranges on her dimpled arm. What a pretty picture she was too&#8211; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span> prettier here even than on
the stage! The nearer, the prettier! A band of roses, one end of which formed a
garland falling to the floor, circled and bound in her curls. What a figure in
her Oriental garb, hiding and revealing. Indeed, the greenroom seemed bewitched
by her cry: &#8220;Oranges, will you have my oranges?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted the basket high and offered the fruit in her enchanting old-time
way, a way which had won for her the place of first actress in England. Could it
not now dispose of Moll&#8217;s wares and make the child happy? Almahyde&#8217;s
royal train was caught up most unroyally, revealing two dainty ankles; and she
laughed and danced and disposed of her wares all in a breath. Listen and
love:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>Sweet as love-lips, dearest mine,<br /> Picked by Spanish maids

</div><!-- poetry -->

<p>There were cries of &#8220;Brava!&#8221; &#8220;Another jig!&#8221; and
&#8220;Hurrah for Nelly!&#8221; It was one of those bits of acting behind the
scenes which are so rare and exquisite and which the audience never see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, gallants, deny me after that, if you dare&#8221;; and
Nell&#8217;s little foot came down firmly in the last step of a triumphant jig,
indicating a determination that Moll&#8217;s oranges should be sold and quickly
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last act! All ready for the last act,&#8221; rang out in Dick&#8217;s
familiar voice from the stage-door as she ended. It was well some one thought of
the play and of the audience in waiting.</p>

<p>Many of the players hastily departed to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_28'></a>28</span> take up their cues; but not so Nell. Her eyes were
upon the lordly Buckingham, who was endeavouring to effect a crafty exit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, my lord,&#8221; she said as she caught his handsome cloak
and drew him back into the room. &#8220;I want you with me.&#8221; She looked
coyly into his lordship&#8217;s face as though he were the one man in all the
world she loved, and her curls and cheek almost nestled against his rich cloak.
&#8220;A dozen, did you say? What a heart you have, my lord. A bountiful
heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham was dazed; his eyes sought Nell, then looked aghast at the oranges
she would force upon him. The impudence of it!</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen!&#8221; he exclaimed in awe. &#8220;&#8217;Slife, Nelly; what would
I do with a dozen oranges?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay for them, in sooth,&#8221; promptly replied the vixen. &#8220;I
never give a lord credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The player-folk gathered closer to watch the scene; for there was evidently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span> more fun brewing,
and that too at the expense of a very royal gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;A player talk of credit!&#8221; replied his lordship, quite
ironically, as he straightened up proudly for a wit-encounter. &#8220;What would
become of the mummers, if the lords did not fill their empty pockets?&#8221; he
said, crushingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would become of the lords, if the players&#8217; brains did not
try to fill their empty skulls with wits?&#8221; quickly retorted Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were a man, sweet Nelly, I should answer: &#8216;The lords first had
fools at court; then supplanted them with players!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, being a woman, I do answer,&#8221; replied the irrepressible
Nell, &#8220;&#8217;&#8211;and played the fools themselves, my
lord!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The players tried to smother their feelings; but the retort was too apt, and
the greenroom rang with laughter.</p>

<p>Buckingham turned fiercely upon them; but their faces were instantly
mummified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad, I would sooner face the Dutch <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_30'></a>30</span> fleet, Nelly. Up go my hands, fair robber,&#8221; he
said. He had decided to succumb for the present. In his finger-tips glistened a
golden guinea.</p>

<p>Nell eyed the coin dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, keep this and your wares too,&#8221; added his lordship, in hope
of peace, as he placed it in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think me a beggar?&#8221; replied Nell, indignantly.
&#8220;Take your possessions, every one&#8211;every orange.&#8221; She filled
his hands and arms to overflowing with her golden wares.</p>

<p>His lordship winced, but stood subdued.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do with them?&#8221; he asked, falteringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat them; eat them,&#8221; promptly and forcefully retorted the
quondam orange-vender.</p>

<p>&#8220;All?&#8221; asked his lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;All!&#8221; replied her ladyship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damme, I cannot hold a dozen,&#8221; he exclaimed, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chair! A chair!&#8221; cried Nell. &#8220;Would your lordship stand
at the feast of gold?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>Before Buckingham
had time to reflect upon the outrage to his dignity, Nell forced him into a
chair, to the great glee of the by-standers, especially of Manager Hart, who
chuckled to an actor by his side: &#8220;She&#8217;ll pluck his fine feathers;
curse his arrogance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your knees together, my lord! What, have they never united in
prayer?&#8221; gleefully laughed Nell as she further humbled his lordship by
forcing his knees together to form a lap upon which to pile more oranges.</p>

<p>Buckingham did not relish the scene; but he was clever enough to humour the
vixen, both from fear of her tongue and from hope of favours as well as words
from her rosy lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll unite to hold <i>thee</i>, wench,&#8221; he suggested,
with a sickly laugh, as he observed his knees well laden with oranges. &#8220;I
trow not,&#8221; retorted Nell; &#8220;they can scarce hold their own.
There!&#8221; and she roguishly capped the pyramid which burdened his
lordship&#8217;s knees with the largest in her basket.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll
barter these back for my change, sweet Nell,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What change?&#8221; quickly cried the merry imp of Satan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave you a golden guinea,&#8221; answered his lordship,
woefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave you a golden dozen, my lord!&#8221; replied Nell,
gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oranges, who will have my oranges?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was done with Buckingham and had turned about for other prey.</p>

<p>Hart could not allow the opportunity to escape without a shot at his hated
lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fleeced,&#8221; he whispered grimly over his lordship&#8217;s
shoulder, with a merry chuckle.</p>

<p>Buckingham rose angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A plague on the wench and her dealings,&#8221; he said. His oranges
rolled far and wide over the floor of the greenroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be proud, my lord, to be robbed by so fair a hand,&#8221;
continued Hart, consolingly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis an honour, I assure you; we all envy
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham did not relish the consolation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis an old
saw, Master Hart,&#8221; he replied: &#8220;&#8216;He laughs best who laughs
last.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Nell&#8217;s orange-cry rang out again above the confusion and
the fun. She was still at it. Moll was finding vengeance and money, indeed,
though she dwelt upon her accumulating possessions through eyelashes dim with
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s near your cue, Mistress Nell,&#8221; cried out the watchful
Dick at the stage-door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six oranges left; see me sell them, Moll,&#8221; cried the unheeding
vender.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s near your cue, Mistress Nell!&#8221; again shouted the
call-boy, in anxious tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, my cue will await my coming, pretty one,&#8221; laughed
Nell.</p>

<p>The boy was not so sure of that. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be late, Mistress
Nell,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy the oranges rather than have you
make a stage-wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear heart,&#8221; replied Nell, touched by the lad&#8217;s
solicitude. &#8220;Keep your pennies, Dick, and you and I will have a lark <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span> with them some fine day.
Six oranges, left; going&#8211;going&#8211;&#8221; She sprang into the
throne-chair, placed one of the smallest feet in England impudently on one of
its arms and proceeded to vend her remaining wares from on high, to the huge
satisfaction of her admirers.</p>

<p>The situation was growing serious. Nell was not to be trifled with. The
actors stood breathless. Hart grew wild as he realized the difficulty and the
fact that she was uncontrollable. King and Parliament, he well knew, could not
move her from her whimsical purpose, much less the manager of the
King&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Nell?&#8221; he pleaded, wildly. &#8220;You will
ruin the first night. His Majesty in front, too! Dryden will never forgive us if
&#8216;Granada&#8217; goes wrong through our fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heyday! What care I for &#8216;Granada&#8217;?&#8221; and Nell swung the
basket of oranges high in air and calmly awaited bids. &#8220;Not a step on the
stage till the basket is empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Buckingham&#8217;s turn now. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_35'></a>35</span> &#8220;Here&#8217;s music for our manager,&#8221; he
chuckled. &#8220;Our deepest sympathy, friend Hart.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was more than Hart could bear. The manager of the King&#8217;s House was
forced into profanity. &#8220;Damn your sympathy,&#8221; exclaimed he; and few
would criticise him for it. He apologized as quickly, however, and turned to
Nell. &#8220;There goes your scene, Nell. I&#8217;ll buy your oranges, when you
come off,&#8221; he continued to plead, in desperation, scarcely less fearful of
offending her than of offending the great Lord Buckingham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now or never,&#8221; calmly replied the vender from her chair-top.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil take the women,&#8221; muttered Hart, frantically, as he
rushed headlong into his tiring-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, Heaven defend,&#8221; laughed Nell; &#8220;for he&#8217;s got
the men already.&#8221; She sprang lightly from the chair to the floor.</p>

<p>Hart was back on the instant, well out of breath but purse in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Never <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span> mind the oranges, wench. The audience
will be waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith and troth, and is not Nell worth waiting for?&#8221; she cried,
her eyes shining radiantly. Indeed, the audience would have gladly waited, could
they have but seen her pretty, winsome way! &#8220;These are
yours&#8211;all&#8211;all!&#8221; she continued, as she gleefully emptied the
basket of its remaining fruit over Prince Almanzor&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Hart protested vainly.</p>

<p>Then rushing back to Moll, Nell threw both arms about the girl triumphantly.
&#8220;There, Moll,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is your basket and all the
trophies&#8221;; and she gave Moll the basket with the glittering coins jangling
in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cue&#8211;your cue is spoken, Mistress Nell,&#8221; shrieked Dick
from the stage-door.</p>

<p>Nell heeded not. Her eyes happening upon an orange which had fallen near the
throne-chair, she caught it up eagerly and hurled it at Manager Hart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forsooth, here&#8217;s another orange, Master Manager.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>He succeeded in
catching it despite his excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cue&#8211;your cue&#8211;Mistress Nell!&#8221; came from every
throat as one.</p>

<p>Nell tossed back her head indifferently. &#8220;Let them wait; let them
wait,&#8221; she said, defiantly.</p>

<p>The stage-beauty crossed leisurely to the glass and carelessly arranged her
drapery and the band of roses encircling her hair.</p>

<p>Then the hoyden was gone. In an instant, Nell was transformed into the
princess, Almahyde. The room had been filled with breathless suspense; but what
seemed to the players an endless period of time was but a minute. Nell turned to
the manager, and with all the suavity of a princess of tragedy kissed her hand
tantalizingly to him and said: &#8220;Now, Jack, I&#8217;ll teach you how to
act.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed out, and, in a moment, rounds of applause from the amphitheatre
filled the room. She was right; the audience would wait for her.</p>

<p>A moment later, the greenroom was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_38'></a>38</span> deserted except for Manager Hart and Lord Buckingham.
Hart had thrown the call-boy almost bodily through the door that led to the
stage, thus venting his anger upon the unoffending lad, who had been unfortunate
enough to happen in his way ill betimes. He now stood vainly contemplating
himself before the glass and awaiting his cue. Buckingham leaned upon a
chair-top, uncertain as to his course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damme! She shall rue this work,&#8221; he muttered at length. &#8220;A
man might as well make love to a wind-mill. I forgot to tell her how her gown
becomes her. That is a careless thing to forget.&#8221; The reflection forthwith
determined his course. &#8220;Nelly, Nelly, Nelly,&#8221; he called as he
quickly crossed the room after the departed Nell, &#8220;you are divine
to-night. Your gown is simply&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager&#8217;s voice stayed him at the stage-door. &#8220;My lord, come
back; my lord&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s hand had gone so far, indeed, as to push open the door. He
stood entranced as he looked out upon the object <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span> of his adoration upon the stage.
&#8220;Perfection!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Your eyes&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, my lord, you forget&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham turned indignantly at the voice which dared to interrupt him in
the midst of his rhapsody.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget&#8211;your oranges, my lord,&#8221; mildly suggested Hart,
as he pointed to the fruit scattered upon the floor.</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s face crimsoned. &#8220;Plague on&#8217;t! They are sour,
Master Hart.&#8221; With a glance of contempt, he turned on his heel and left
the room.</p>

<p>A triumphant smile played upon the manager&#8217;s face. He felt that he had
annoyed his lordship without his intention being apparent. &#8220;A good exit,
on my honour,&#8221; he muttered, as he stood contemplating the door through
which Buckingham had passed; &#8220;but, by Heaven, he shall better it unless he
takes his eyes from Nell. Great men believe themselves resistless with the fair;
more often, the fair are resistless with great men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a final look at himself in the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_40'></a>40</span> glass, adjusted his scimiter; and, well satisfied
with himself and the conceit of his epigram unheard save by himself, he also
departed, to take up his cue.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>He took them from Castlemaine&#8217;s hand to throw to
you.</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The greenroom seemed like some old forest rent by a storm. Its furniture,
which was none too regular at best, either in carving or arrangement, had the
irregularity which comes only with a tempest, human or divine. The table, it is
true, still stood on its four oaken legs; but even it was well awry. The chairs
were scattered here and there, some resting upon their backs. To add to all
this, oranges in confusion were strewn broadcast upon the floor.</p>

<p>A storm in fact had visited the greenroom. The storm was Nell.</p>

<p>In the midst of the confusion, a jolly old face peeped cautiously in at the
door which led to the street. At the sound of Manager Hart&#8217;s thunderous
tones coming from the stage, however, it as promptly disappeared, only to return
when the apparent <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
danger ceased. It was a rare old figure and a rare old dress and a rare old man.
Yet, not an old man either. His face was red; for he was a tavern spirit, well
known and well beloved,&#8211;a lover of good ale! Across his back hung a fiddle
which too had the appearance of being the worse for wear, if fiddles can ever be
said to be the worse for wear.</p>

<p>The intruder took off his dilapidated hat, hugged his fiddle closely under
his arm and looked about the room, more cautiously than respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oons, here is a scattering of props; a warfare of the
orange-wenches!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;A wise head comes into battle after
the last shot is fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>He proceeded forthwith to fill his pockets, of which there seemed to be an
abundance of infinite depth, with oranges. This done, he calmly made a hole in
the next orange which came to his hand and began to suck it loudly and
persistently, boy-fashion, meanwhile smacking his lips. His face was one wreath
of unctuous smiles. &#8220;There is but one way to eat an <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span> orange,&#8221; he chuckled;
&#8220;that&#8217;s through a hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment, Hart&#8217;s voice was heard again upon the stage, and the
new-comer to the greenroom liked to have dropped his orange. &#8220;Odsbud,
that&#8217;s one of Master Hart&#8217;s love-tones,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I
must see Nell before he sees me, or it will be farewell Strings.&#8221; He
hastened to Nell&#8217;s tiring-room and rapped lightly on the door.
&#8220;Mistress Nell! Mistress Nell!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>The door opened, but it was not Nell. Her maid pointed toward the stage.
Strings&#8211;for Strings was his name, or at least none knew him by a
better&#8211;accordingly hobbled across the room&#8211;for the wars too had left
their mark on him&#8211;and peeped off in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad,&#8221; he exclaimed, gleefully clapping his hands, &#8220;there
she goes on the stage as a Moorish princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a storm of applause without.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, Nelly, bravo!&#8221; he continued. &#8220;She&#8217;s caught
the lads in the pit. They <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_44'></a>44</span> worship Nell out there.&#8221; The old fellow
straightened up as if he felt a personal pride in the audience for evincing such
good taste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oons! Jack Hart struts about like a young game-cock at his first
fight,&#8221; he observed. He broke into an infectious laugh, which would have
been a fine basso for Nell&#8217;s laugh.</p>

<p>From the manager, his eye turned toward the place which he himself had once
occupied among the musicians. He began to dance up and down with both feet, his
knees well bent, boy-fashion, and to clap his hands wildly. &#8220;Look ye,
little Tompkins got my old place with the fiddle. Whack, de-doodle-de-do! Whack,
de-doodle, de-doodle-de-do!&#8221; he cried, giving grotesque imitations to his
own great glee of his successor as leader of the orchestra.</p>

<p>Then, shaking his head, confident of his own superiority with the bow, he
turned back into the greenroom and, with his mouth half full of orange, uttered
the droll dictum: &#8220;It will take more than catgut <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span> and horse-hair to make you a fiddler,
Tommy, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Strings stood blandly sucking his orange with personal satisfaction in
the centre of the room, when Dick entered from the stage. The call-boy paused as
if he could not believe his eyes. He looked and looked again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigh-ho!&#8221; he exclaimed at last, and then rushed across the room
to greet the old fiddler. &#8220;Why, Strings, I thought we would never see you
again; how fares it with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Strings placed the orange which he had been eating and which he knew full
well was none of his own well behind him; and, assuming an unconcerned and
serious air, he replied: &#8220;Odd! A little the worse for wear, Dickey, me and
the old fiddle, but still smiling with the world.&#8221; There was a bit of a
twinkle in his eye as he spoke.</p>

<p>Dick, ever mindful of the welfare and appearance of the theatre, unhooked
from the wall a huge shield, which mayhap had served some favourite knight of
yore, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> and, using it
as a tray, proceeded to gather the scattered fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have an orange?&#8221; he inquired of Strings, who still stood in a
reflective mood in the centre of the room, as he rested in his labours by
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How; do they belong to you?&#8221; demanded Strings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; admitted Dick, &#8220;but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The fiddler instantly assumed an air of injured innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;offer me what don&#8217;t belong
to you?&#8221; He turned upon the boy almost ferociously at the bare thought.
&#8220;Honesty is the best policy,&#8221; he continued, seriously. &#8220;I have
tried both, lad&#8221;; and, in his eagerness to impress upon the boy the
seriousness of taking that which does not belong to you, he gestured
inadvertently with the hand which till now had held the stolen orange well
behind him.</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s eye fell upon it, and so did Strings&#8217;s. There was a
moment&#8217;s awkwardness, and then both burst into a peal of joyous
laughter.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/nell-046.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
A FRIEND EVEN UNTO HER WORST ENEMY.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;Oh, well,
egad,&#8211;I <i>will</i> join you, Dick,&#8221; said Strings, with more
patronage still than apology. He seated himself upon the table and began anew to
suck his orange in philosophic fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, mind you, lad; never again offer that which is not your own, for
there you are twice cursed,&#8221; he discoursed pompously. &#8220;You make him
who receives guilty of your larceny. Oons, my old wound.&#8221; He winced from
pain. &#8220;He becomes an accomplice in your crime. So says the King&#8217;s
law. Hush, lad, I am devouring the evidence of your guilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy by this time had placed the shield of oranges in the corner of the
room and had returned to listen to Strings&#8217;s discourse. &#8220;You speak
with the learning of a solicitor,&#8221; he said, as he looked respectfully into
the old fiddler&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Strings met the glance with due dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, I&#8217;ve often been in the presence of a judge,&#8221; he
replied, with great solemnity. His face reflected the ups and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span> downs in his career as he
made the confession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that where you have been, Strings, all these long days?&#8221;
asked Dick, innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid!&#8221; exclaimed Strings, with sadly retrospective
countenance. &#8220;Travelling, lad&#8211;contemplating the world, from the
King&#8217;s highways. Take note, my boy,&#8211;a prosperous man! I came into
the world without a rag that I could call my own, and now I have an abundance.
Saith the philosopher: Some men are born to rags, some achieve rags and some
have rags thrust upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you were back with us, Strings,&#8221; said the boy,
sympathetically, as he put a hand upon Strings&#8217;s broad shoulder and looked
admiringly up into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish so myself,&#8221; replied the fiddler. &#8220;Thrice a day, I
grow lonesome here.&#8221; A weather-beaten hand indicated the spot where good
dinners should be.</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t all forgot you, Strings,&#8221; continued his
companion, consolingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>&#8220;Right,
lad!&#8221; said Strings, musingly, as he lifted the old viol close against his
cheek and tenderly picked it. &#8220;The old fiddle is true to me yet, though
there is but one string left to its dear old neck.&#8221; There was a sob in his
voice as he spoke. &#8220;I tell you, a fiddle&#8217;s human, Dick! It laughs at
my jokes alone now; it weeps at my sorrows.&#8221; He sighed deeply and the
tears glistened in his eyes. &#8220;The fiddle is the only friend left me and
the little ones at home now, my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8211;And Dick!&#8221; the boy suggested, somewhat hurt. He too was
weeping. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame; that&#8217;s what it is!&#8221; he broke
out, indignantly. &#8220;Tompkins can&#8217;t play the music like you used to,
Strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oons!&#8221; exclaimed the fiddler, the humour in his nature bubbling
again to the surface. &#8220;It&#8217;s only now and then the Lord has time to
make a fiddler, Dickey, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the greenroom shook with the rounds of applause from the pit and
galleries without.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; he shouted, following <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_50'></a>50</span> Dick to the stage-door&#8211;his own sorrows melting
before the sunshine of his joy at the success of his favourite. &#8220;Nell has
caught them with the epilogue.&#8221; He danced gleefully about, entering
heartily into the applause and totally forgetful of the fact that he was on
dangerous ground.</p>

<p>Dick was more watchful. &#8220;Manager Hart&#8217;s coming!&#8221; he
exclaimed in startled voice, fearful for the welfare of his friend.</p>

<p>Strings collapsed. &#8220;Oh, Lord, let me be gone,&#8221; he said, as he
remembered the bitter quarrel he had had with the manager of the King&#8217;s
House, which ended in the employment of Tompkins. He did not yearn for another
interview; for Hart had forbidden him the theatre on pain of whipping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can you hide?&#8221; whispered Dick, woefully, as the
manager&#8217;s voice indicated that he was approaching the greenroom, and that
too in far from the best of humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behind Richard&#8217;s throne-chair! It has held sinners before
now,&#8221; added the fiddler as he glided well out of sight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>Dick was more
cautious. In a twinkling, he was out of the door which led to the street.</p>

<p>The greenroom walls looked grim in the sputtering candle-light, but they had
naught to say.</p>

<p>The door from the stage opened, and in came Nell. There was something sadly
beautiful and pathetic in her face. She had enjoyed but now one of the grandest
triumphs known to the theatre, and yet she seemed oblivious to the applause and
bravas, to the lights and to the royalty.</p>

<p>A large bouquet of flowers was in her arms&#8211;a bouquet of red roses. Her
lips touched them reverently. Her eyes, however, were far away in a dream of the
past.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the hand of the King of England!&#8221; she mused softly to
herself. &#8220;The King? How like his face to the youthful cavalier, who weary
and worn reined in his steed a summer&#8217;s day, now long ago, and took a
gourd of water from my hand. Could he have been the King? Pooh, pooh! I dream
again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>She turned away,
as from herself, with a heart-heavy laugh. The manager entered from the
stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Jack, my flowers,&#8221; she said, again in an ecstasy of
happiness. &#8220;Are they not exquisite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He took them from Castlemaine&#8217;s hand to throw to you,&#8221;
snarled Hart, jealously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sweeter, then!&#8221; and Nell broke into a tantalizing laugh.
&#8220;Mayhap he was teaching the player-king to do likewise, Jack,&#8221; she
added, roguishly, as she arranged the flowers in a vase.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in no mood for wit-thrusts,&#8221; replied Hart as he fretfully
paced the room. &#8220;You played that scene like an icicle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In sooth, your acting froze me,&#8221; slyly retorted Nell, kindly but
pointedly. She took the sweetest roses from the bunch, kissed them and arranged
them in her bosom.</p>

<p>This did not improve Hart&#8217;s temper.</p>

<p>Strings seized the opportunity to escape from his hiding-place to the
stage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>&#8220;I say, you
completely ruined my work,&#8221; said Hart. &#8220;The audience were rightly
displeased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you, perhaps,&#8221; suggested Nell. &#8220;I did not observe the
feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart could no longer control himself. &#8220;You vilely read those glorious
lines:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;See how the gazing People crowd the Place;<br /> All gaping to be
fill&#8217;d with my Disgrace.<br /> That Shout, like the hoarse Peals of
Vultures rings,<br /> When, over fighting Fields they beat their
wings.&#8221;</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;And how should I read them, dear master?&#8221; she asked demurely of
her vainglorious preceptor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like I read them, in sooth,&#8221; replied he, well convinced that his
reading could not be bettered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like you read them, in sooth,&#8221; replied Nell, meekly. She took
the floor and repeated the lines with the precise action and trick of voice
which Hart had used. Every &#8220;r&#8221; was well trilled;
&#8220;gaping&#8221; was pronounced with an anaconda-look, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span> as though she were about to swallow the
theatre, audience and all; and, as she spoke the line, &#8220;When, over
fighting Fields they beat their wings,&#8221; she raised her arms and shoulders
in imitation of some barn-yard fowl vainly essaying flight and swept across the
room, the picture of grace in ungracefulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis monstrous!&#8221; exclaimed Hart, bitterly, as he realized the
travesty. &#8220;You cannot act and never could. I was a fool to engage
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell was back by the vase, toying with the flowers. &#8220;London applauds my
acting,&#8221; she suggested, indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;London applauds the face and figure; not the art,&#8221; replied
Hart.</p>

<p>&#8220;London is wise; for the art is in the face and figure, Master Jack.
You told me so yourself,&#8221; she added, sharply, pointing her finger at her
adversary in quick condemnation. She turned away triumphant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a fool like the rest,&#8221; replied Hart, visibly irritated
that he could not get the better of the argument.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>&#8220;Come,
don&#8217;t be angry,&#8221; said Nell. Her manner had changed; for her heart
had made her fearful lest her tongue had been unkind. &#8220;Mayhap Almahyde is
the last part Nell will ever play.&#8221; She looked thoughtfully into the bunch
of roses. Did she see a prophecy there?</p>

<p>He approached the table where she stood. &#8220;Your head is turned by the
flowers,&#8221; he said, bitterly. &#8220;An honest motive, no doubt, prompted
the royal gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell turned sharply upon him. Her lips trembled, but one word only came to
them&#8211;&#8220;Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart&#8217;s eyes fell under the rebuke; for he knew that only anger prompted
what he had said. He would have struck another for the same words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Nell,&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;My heart rebukes my
tongue. I love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell stepped back to the mirror, contemplating herself, bedecked as she was
with the flowers. In an instant she forgot all, and replied playfully to
Hart&#8217;s confession of love: &#8220;Of course, you do. How could you help
it? So do others.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;I love you
better than the rest,&#8221; he added, vehemently, &#8220;better than my
life.&#8221; He tried to put his arms about her.</p>

<p>Nell, however, was by him like a flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, dear sir,&#8221; she said, coyly; and she tiptoed across
the room and ensconced herself high in the throne-chair.</p>

<p>Hart followed and knelt below her, adoring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit that I can act&#8211;a little&#8211;just a little&#8211;dear
Hart, or tell me no more of love.&#8221; She spoke with the half-amused,
half-indifferent air of a beautiful princess to some servant-suitor; and she
was, indeed, most lovable as she leaned back in the great throne-chair. She
seemed a queen and the theatre her realm. Her beautiful arms shone white in the
flickering candle-light. Her sceptre was a rose which the King of England had
given her.</p>

<p>Hart stepped back and looked upon the picture. &#8220;By heaven, Nell,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;I spoke in anger. You are the most marvellous actress in the
world. Nature, art and genius crown your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell smiled at his vehemence. &#8220;I begin <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span> to think that you have taste most excellent,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Hart sprang to her side, filled with hope. As the stage-lover he ne&#8217;er spoke
in tenderer tones. &#8220;Sweet Nell, when I found you in the pit, a ragged
orange-girl, I saw the sparkle in your eye, the bright intelligence, the magic
genius, which artists love. I claimed you for my art, which is the art of
arts&#8211;for it embraces all. I had the theatre. I gave it you. You captured
the Lane&#8211;then London. You captured my soul as well, and held it
slave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I do all that, dear Jack?&#8221; she asked, wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And more,&#8221; said Hart, rapturously. &#8220;You captured my years
to come, my hope, ambition, love&#8211;all. All centred in your heart and eyes,
sweet Nell, from the hour I first beheld you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s look was far away. &#8220;Is love so beautiful?&#8221; she
murmured softly. Her eye fell upon her sceptre-rose. &#8220;Yea, I begin to
think it is.&#8221; She mused a moment, until the silence seemed to awaken her.
She looked into Hart&#8217;s eyes again, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_58'></a>58</span> sadly but firmly, then spoke as with an effort:
&#8220;You paint the picture well, dear Jack. Paint on.&#8221; Her hand waved
commandingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not paint ill with such a model,&#8221; said he, his voice
full of adoration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well said,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;and by my troth, I have relented
like you, dear Jack. I admit you too can act&#8211;and marvellously well.&#8221;
She took his trembling hand and descended from the throne. He tried once again
to embrace her, but she avoided him as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&#8217;t true?&#8221; he asked, eagerly, without observing the
hidden meaning in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true, indeed&#8211;with proper emphasis and proper art and proper
intonation.&#8221; She crossed the room, Hart following her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarce can live for joy,&#8221; he breathed.</p>

<p>Nell leaned back upon the table and looked knowingly and deeply into
Hart&#8217;s eyes. Her voice grew very low, but clear and full of meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;In faith,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I trow and sadly <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span> speak but true; for I am
sad at times&#8211;yea&#8211;very sad&#8211;when I observe, with all my
woman&#8217;s wiles and arts, I cannot act the hypocrite like men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What mean you, darling cynic?&#8221; asked he, jocosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; she cried, repeating the word, with a peculiar look.
&#8220;To tell two girls within the hour you love each to the death would be in
me hypocrisy, I admit, beyond my art; but you men can do such things with
conscience clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart turned away his face. &#8220;She&#8217;s found me out,&#8221; he
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, I never loved the Spanish dancing-girl. You know I love but
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; laughed Nell. &#8220;Then why did you tell her
so?&#8211;to break her heart or mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager stood confused. He scarce knew what to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are cruel, Nell,&#8221; he pleaded, fretfully. &#8220;You never
loved me, never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I ever say I did?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, don&#8217;t pout, Jack. An armistice <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span> in this, my friend, for you were my
friend in the old days when I needed one, and I love you for that.&#8221; She
placed her hands kindly on the manager&#8217;s shoulders, then turned and began
to arrange anew the gift-flowers in the vase.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll win your life&#8217;s love, Nell, in spite of you,&#8221;
he said, determinedly.</p>

<p>She turned her honest eyes upon him. &#8220;Nay, do not try; believe me, do
not try,&#8221; she said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, you do not mean&#8211;?&#8221; His voice faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not love me,&#8221; she said, firmly; &#8220;believe me, you
must not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not love you!&#8221; His voice scarcely breathed the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there; we are growing sentimental, Jack,&#8211;and at our
age,&#8221; she replied. She laughed gaily and started for her tiring-room.</p>

<p>He followed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sup with me, Nell,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;No word of this, I
promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heyday, I&#8217;ll see how good you are, Jack,&#8221; she answered,
cordially.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>&#8220;My second
bid to sup to-night,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;Who sets the better
feast?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tiring-room door was open; and the little candles danced gleefully about
the make-up mirror, for even candles seemed happy when Nell came near. The maid
stood ready to assist her to a gown and wrap, that she might leave the
theatre.</p>

<p>Nell turned. Hart still stood waiting. The spirit of kindness
o&#8217;er-mastered her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hand, friend, your hand,&#8221; she said, taking the
manager&#8217;s hand. &#8220;When next you try to win a woman&#8217;s love,
don&#8217;t throw away her confidence; for you will never get it back again
entire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart bowed his head under the rebuke; and she entered her room.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>Flowers and Music feed naught but Love.</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The manager stood a moment looking through the half-closed door at Nell.
There was a strange mingling of contending forces at work in his nature. To be
sure, he had trifled with the affections of the Spanish dancing-girl, a new
arrival from Madrid and one of the latest attractions of the King&#8217;s House;
but it was his pride, when he discovered that Nell&#8217;s sharp eyes had found
him out, that suffered, not his conscience. Was he not the fascinating
actor-manager of the House? Could he prevent the ladies loving him? Must he be
accused of not loving Nell, simply because his charms had edified the shapely
new-comer? Nell&#8217;s rebuke had depressed him, but there was a smouldering
fire within. &#8220;&#8217;Slife!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;If I do not steal my way
into Nell&#8217;s heart, I&#8217;ll abandon the rouge-box and till the
soil.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>As he approached
his tiring-room, he bethought him that it would be well first to have an
oversight of the theatre. He turned accordingly and pulled open the door that
led to the stage.</p>

<p>As he did so, a figure fell into the greenroom, grasping devotedly a violin,
lest his fall might injure it. Strings had been biding his time, waiting an
opportunity to see Nell, and had fallen asleep behind the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, dog!&#8221; exclaimed the manager when he saw who the
intruder was.</p>

<p>Strings hastened to his feet and hobbled across the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you not to set foot here again,&#8221; shouted Hart, following
him virulently.</p>

<p>Strings bowed meekly. &#8220;I thought the King&#8217;s House in need of a
player; so I came back, sir,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Hart was instantly beside himself. &#8220;Zounds!&#8221; he stormed. &#8220;I
have had enough impudence to contend with to-night. Begone; or up you go for a
vagrant.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;I called on
Mistress Gwyn, sir,&#8221; explained Strings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Gwyn does not receive drunkards,&#8221; fiercely retorted
Hart; and he started hastily to the stage-door and called loudly for his force
of men to put the fiddler out.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s door was still ajar. She had removed the roses from her hair and
dress. She caught at once her name. Indeed, there was little that went on which
Nell did not see or hear, even though walls intervened. &#8220;Who takes my name
in vain?&#8221; she called. Her head popped through the opening left by the
door, and she scanned the room.</p>

<p>As her eye fell upon the old fiddler, who had often played songs and dances
for her in days gone by, a cry of joy came from her lips. She rushed into the
greenroom and threw both arms about Strings&#8217;s neck. &#8220;My old comrade,
as I live,&#8221; she cried, dancing about him. &#8220;I am joyed to see you,
Strings!&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning, she saw the manager eying them with fiery glances. She knew the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span> situation and the
feeling. &#8220;Jack, is it not good to have Strings back?&#8221; she asked,
sweetly.</p>

<p>Hart&#8217;s face grew livid with anger. He could see the merry devil dancing
in her eye and on her tongue. He knew the hoyden well. &#8220;Gad, I will resign
management.&#8221; He turned on his heel, entered his tiring-room and closed the
door, none too gently. He feared to tarry longer, lest he might say too
much.</p>

<p>Nell broke into a merry laugh; and the fiddler chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You desert me these days, Strings,&#8221; she said, as she leaned
against the table and fondly eyed the wayfarer of the tattered garments and
convivial spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t love your lackey-in-waiting, Mistress Nell,&#8221; said
he, with a wink in the direction of the departed manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Jack. Never mind him,&#8221; she said, with a roguish laugh,
though with no touch of malice in it, for there was devil without malice in
Nell&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>As she again sought the eyes of the fiddler, her face grew thoughtful. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
spoke&#8211;hesitated&#8211;and then spoke again, as if the thought gave her
pain. &#8220;Have you kept your word to me, Strings, and
stopped&#8211;drinking?&#8221; she asked. The last word fell faintly,
tremblingly, from her lips&#8211;almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Nell, I&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221; Strings&#8217;s eyes fell
quickly.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s arm was lovingly about him in an instant. &#8220;There, there;
don&#8217;t tell me, Strings. Try again, and come and see me often.&#8221; There
was a delicacy in her voice and way more beautiful than the finest acting. The
words had hurt her more than him. She changed her manner in an instant.</p>

<p>Not so with Strings. The tears were in his eyes. &#8220;Mistress Nell, you
are so good to me,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and I am such a wretch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are, Strings,&#8221; and she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taught my little ones at home who it is that keeps the wolf
from our door,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word of that!&#8221; she exclaimed, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span> reprovingly. &#8220;Poor old
fellow!&#8221; Her eyes grew big and bright as she reflected on the days she had
visited the fiddler&#8217;s home and on the happiness her gifts had brought his
children. For her, giving was better than receiving. The feeling sprang from the
fulness of her own joy at seeing those about her happy, and not from the
teachings of priests or prelates. Dame Nature was her sole preceptor in
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the babes another sugar plum to-morrow. I
haven&#8217;t a farthing to-night. Moll ran away with the earnings, and there is
no one left to rob,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heyday,&#8221; and she ran lightly to the vase and caught up the
flowers. &#8220;Take the flowers to the bright eyes, to make them
brighter.&#8221; They would at least add cheerfulness to the room where Strings
lived until she could bring something better.</p>

<p>As she looked at the roses, she began to realize how dear they were becoming
to herself, for they were the King&#8217;s gift; and her heart beat quickly and
she touched the great red petals lovingly with her lips.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>Strings took the
flowers awkwardly; and, as he did so, something fell upon the floor. He knelt
and picked it up, in his eagerness letting the roses fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ring among the flowers, Mistress Nell,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ring!&#8221; she exclaimed, taking the jewel quickly. Her lips
pressed the setting. &#8220;Bless his heart! A ring from his finger,&#8221; she
continued half aloud. &#8220;Is it not handsome, Strings?&#8221; Her eyes
sparkled brightly and there was a triumphant smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>The fiddler&#8217;s face, however, was grave; his eyes were on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many have rings like that, while others starve,&#8221; he mused,
seriously.</p>

<p>Nell held the jewel at arm&#8217;s length and watched its varying brightness
in the candle-light. &#8220;We can moralize, now we have the ring,&#8221; she
said, by way of rejoinder, then broke into a ringing laugh at her own
way-of-the-world philosophizing. &#8220;Bless the giver!&#8221; she added, in a
mood of rhapsody.</p>

<p>She turned, only again to observe the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_69'></a>69</span> sad countenance of Strings. &#8220;Alack-a-day! Why
do you not take the nosegay?&#8221; she asked, wonderingly; for she herself was
so very happy that she could not see why Strings too should not be so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not feed my little ones, Mistress Nell,&#8221; he answered,
sadly.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s heart was touched in an instant. &#8220;Too true!&#8221; she
said, sympathetically, falling on her knee and lovingly gathering up the roses.
&#8220;Flowers and Music feed naught but Love, and often then Love goes
hungry&#8211;very hungry.&#8221; Her voice was so sweet and tender that it
seemed as though the old viol had caught the notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night, Mistress Nell,&#8221; said Strings, &#8220;the old fiddle
played its sweetest melody for them, but they cried as if their tiny hearts
would break. They were starving, and I had nothing but music for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Starving!&#8221; Nell listened to the word as though at first she did
not realize its meaning. &#8220;What can I send?&#8221; she cried, looking about
in vain and into her tiring-room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>Her eyes fell
suddenly upon the rich jewel upon her finger. &#8220;No, no; I cannot think of
that,&#8221; she thought.</p>

<p>Then the word &#8220;starving&#8221; came back to her again with all its
force. &#8220;Starving!&#8221; Her imagination pictured all its horrors.
&#8220;Starving&#8221; seemed written on every wall and on the ceiling. It
pierced her heart and brain. &#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; she exclaimed, wildly.
&#8220;Here, Strings, old fellow, take the ring to the babes, to cut their teeth
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strings stood aghast. &#8220;No, Mistress Nell; it is a present. You must
not,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are others where that came from,&#8221; generously laughed
Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not; you are too kind,&#8221; he continued, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, pooh! I insist,&#8221; said Nell as she forced the jewel upon
him. &#8220;It will make a pretty mouthful; and, besides, I do not want my
jewels to outshine me.&#8221;</p>

NELL PREVENTS A QUARREL.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>Strings would have
followed her and insisted upon her taking back the beautiful gift, but Nell was
gone in an instant and her door closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To cut their teeth on!&#8221; he repeated as he placed the jewelled
ring wonderingly upon his bow-finger and watched it sparkle and laugh in the
light as he pretended to play a tune. &#8220;She is always joking like that;
Heaven reward her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood lost in the realization of sudden affluence.</p>

<p>Buckingham entered the room from the stage-door. His eyes were full of
excitement. &#8220;The audience are wild over Nell, simply wild,&#8221; he
exclaimed in his enthusiasm, unconscious of the fact that he had an auditor, who
was equally oblivious of his lordship&#8217;s presence. &#8220;Gad,&#8221; he
continued, rapturously, half aloud, half to himself, &#8220;when they are
stumbling home through London fog, the great <i>comédienne</i> will be playing
o&#8217;er the love-scenes with Buckingham in a cosy corner of an inn. She will
not dare deny my bid to supper, with all her impudence. <i>Un petit
souper!</i>&#8221; He broke into a laugh. &#8220;Tis well Old Rowley was too
engaged <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span> to look
twice at Nelly&#8217;s eyes,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;His Majesty shall never
meet the wench at arm&#8217;s length, an I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He observed or rather became aware for the first time that there was another
occupant of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sirrah,&#8221; he called, without noting the character of his
companion, &#8220;inform Mistress Nell, Buckingham is waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strings looked up. He seemed to have grown a foot in contemplation of his
sudden wealth. Indeed, each particular tatter on his back seemed to have assumed
an independent air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inform her yourself!&#8221; he declared; and his manner might well
have become the dress of Buckingham. &#8220;Lord Strings is not your lackey this
season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham gazed at him in astonishment, followed by amusement. &#8220;Lord
Strings!&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Lord Rags!&#8221;</p>

<p>Strings approached his lordship with a familiar, princely air. &#8220;How
does that look on my bow-finger, my lord?&#8221; and he <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span> flourished his hand wearing the ring
where Buckingham could well observe it.</p>

<p>His lordship started. &#8220;The King&#8217;s ring!&#8221; he would have
exclaimed, had not the diplomat in his nature restrained him. &#8220;A fine
stone!&#8221; he said merely. &#8220;How came you by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell gave it to me,&#8221; Strings answered.</p>

<p>Buckingham nearly revealed himself in his astonishment. &#8220;Nell!&#8221;
he muttered; and his face grew black as he wondered if his Majesty had
out-generalled him. &#8220;Damme,&#8221; he observed aloud, inspecting the ring
closely, &#8220;I have taken a fancy to this gem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; ejaculated Strings, as he avoided his lordship and
strutted across the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you fifty guineas for it,&#8221; said Buckingham,
following him more eagerly than the driver of a good bargain is wont.</p>

<p>Strings stood nonplussed. &#8220;Fifty guineas!&#8221; he exclaimed, aghast.
This was more money than the fiddler had ever thought existed.
&#8220;Now?&#8221; he asked, wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221;
replied his lordship, who proceeded at once to produce the glittering coins and
toss them temptingly before the fiddler&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oons, Nell surely meant me to sell it,&#8221; he cried as he eagerly
seized the gold and fed his eyes upon it. &#8220;Odsbud, I always did love
yellow.&#8221; He tossed some of the coins in the air and caught them with the
dexterity of a juggler.</p>

<p>Buckingham grew impatient. He desired a delivery. &#8220;Give me the
ring,&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Strings looked once more at the glittering gold; and visions of the plenty
which it insured to his little home, to say nothing of a flagon or two of good
brown ale which could be had by himself and his boon comrades without
disparagement to the dinners of the little ones, came before him. If he had ever
possessed moral courage, it was gone upon the instant. &#8220;Done!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;Oons, fifty guineas!&#8221; and he handed the ring to
Buckingham.</p>

<p>The fiddler was still absorbed in his possessions, whispering again and again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span> to the round bits of
yellow: &#8220;My little bright-eyes will not go to bed hungry to-night!&#8221;
when Manager Hart entered proudly from his tiring-room, dressed to leave the
theatre.</p>

<p>Buckingham nodded significantly. &#8220;Not a word of this,&#8221; he said,
indicating the ring, which he had quickly transferred to his own finger, turning
the jewel so that it could not be observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath, you still here?&#8221; said Hart, sharply, as his eyes fell
upon the fiddler.</p>

<p>Strings straightened up and puffed with the pomposity and pride of a landed
proprietor. He shook his newly acquired possessions until the clinking of the
gold was plainly audible to the manager.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still here, Master Hart, negotiating. When you are pressed for coin,
call on me, Master Hart. I run the Exchequer,&#8221; he said, patronizingly. It
was humorous to see his air of sweeping condescension toward the tall and
dignified manager of the theatre who easily overtopped him by a head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold!&#8221; exclaimed Hart, as he observed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span> the glitter of the guineas in the
candle-light. His eyes turned quickly and suspiciously upon the lordly
Buckingham.</p>

<p>There was nothing, however, in his lordship&#8217;s face to indicate that he
was aware even of the existence of the fiddler or of his gold. He sat by the
table, leaning carelessly upon it, his face filled with an expression of supreme
satisfaction. He had the attitude of one who was waiting for somebody or
something and confidently expected not to be disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sup with me, Hart,&#8221; continued Strings, with the air of a boon
comrade. &#8220;Sup with me&#8211;venison, capons, and&#8211;Epsom
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I am engaged to supper,&#8221; replied Hart,
contemptuously, brushing his cloak where it had been touched by the fiddler, as
if his fingers had contaminated it.</p>

<p>The insult clearly observable in the manager&#8217;s tone, however, had no
effect whatever upon Strings. He tossed his head proudly and said indifferently:
&#8220;Oh, very well. Strings will sup with Strings. My <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> coach, my coach, I say. Drive me to my
bonnie babes!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed open the door with a lordly air and passed out; and, for some
seconds, they heard a mingling of repeated demands for the coach and a strain of
music which sounded like &#8220;Away dull care; prythee away from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham had observed the fiddler&#8217;s tilt with the manager and the
royal exit of the ragged fellow with much amusement. &#8220;A merry wag! Who is
that?&#8221; he asked, as Strings&#8217;s voice grew faint in the entry-way.</p>

<p>Hart was strutting actor-fashion before the mirror, arranging his curls to
hang gracefully over his forehead and tilting now and again the big plumed hat.
&#8220;A knave of fortune, it seems,&#8221; he answered coolly and still
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Family?&#8221; asked Buckingham, indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twins, I warrant,&#8221; replied Hart, in an irritated tone.</p>

<p>Buckingham chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder he&#8217;s tattered and gray,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span> he declared, humorously philosophizing
upon Hart&#8217;s reply, though it was evident that Hart himself was too much
chafed by the presence of his lordship in the greenroom after the play to know
what he really had said.</p>

<p>An ominous coolness now pervaded the atmosphere. Buckingham sat by the table,
impatiently tapping the floor with his boot, his eyes growing dark at the delay.
Hart still plumed himself before the mirror. His dress was rich; his sword was
well balanced, a Damascus blade; his cloak hung gracefully; his big black hat
and plumes were jaunty. He had, too, vigour in his step. With it all, however,
he was a social outcast, and he felt it, while his companion, whose faults of
nature were none the less glaring than his own, was almost the equal of a
king.</p>

<p>There was a tap at Nell&#8217;s door. It was the call-boy, who had slipped
unobserved into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Dick?&#8221; asked Nell, sweetly, as she opened the door
slightly to inspect her visitor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>&#8220;A
message,&#8211;very important,&#8221; whispered Dick, softly, as he passed a
note within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied the actress; and the door closed again.</p>

<p>Dick was about to depart, when the alert Buckingham, rising hastily from his
seat, called him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Nell&#8217;s voice?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my lord. She&#8217;s dressing,&#8221; answered Dick. &#8220;Good
night, Master Hart,&#8221; he added, as he saw the manager.</p>

<p>Hart, however, was not in a good humour and turned sharply upon him. Dick
vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be out shortly, my lord,&#8221; the manager observed to
Buckingham, somewhat coldly. &#8220;But it will do you little good,&#8221; he
thought, as he reflected upon his conversation with Nell.</p>

<p>Buckingham leaned lazily over the back of a chair and replied confidently,
knowing that his speech would be no balm to the irate manager: &#8220;Nell
always keeps her engagements religiously with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_80'></a>80</span> me. We are to sup together to-night, Hart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odso!&#8221; retorted the other, drawing himself up to his full
height. &#8220;You will be disappointed, methinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trow not,&#8221; Buckingham observed, with a smile which made Hart
wince. &#8220;Pepys&#8217;s wife has him mewed up at home when Nelly plays, and
the King is tied to other apron-strings.&#8221; His lordship chuckled as he
bethought him how cleverly he had managed that his Majesty be under the proper
influence. &#8220;What danger else?&#8221; he inquired, cuttingly.</p>

<p>Though the words were mild, the feelings of the two men were at
white-heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship&#8217;s hours are too valuable to waste,&#8221; politely
suggested the manager. &#8220;I happen to know Mistress Gwyn sups with another
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another?&#8221; sneered his lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another!&#8221; hotly repeated the actor.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see, friend Hart,&#8221; said Buckingham, in a tone no less
agreeable, with difficulty restraining his feelings.</p>

<p>He threw himself impatiently into a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_81'></a>81</span> big arm-chair, which he had swung around angrily, so
that its back was to the manager.</p>

<p>The insult was more than Hart could bear. He also seized a chair, and vented
his vengeance upon it. Almost hurled from its place, it fell back to back with
Buckingham&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see, my lord,&#8221; he said as he likewise angrily took his
seat and folded his arms.</p>

<p>It was like &#8220;The Schism&#8221; of Vibert.</p>

<p>It is difficult to tell what would have been the result, had the place been
different. Each knew that Nell was just beyond her door; each hesitated; and
each, with bitterness in his heart, held on to himself. They sat like
sphinxes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nell&#8217;s door slightly opened. She was dressed to leave the
theatre. In her hand she held a note.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fair message, on my honour! Worth reading twice or even
thrice,&#8221; she roguishly exclaimed unto her maid as she directed her to hold
a candle nearer that she might once again spell out its <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> words. &#8220;&#8216;To England&#8217;s idol,
the divine Eleanor Gwyn.&#8217; A holy apt beginning, by the mass! &#8216;My coach
awaits you at the stage-door. We will toast you to-night at
Whitehall.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s eyes seemed to drink in the words, and it was her heart which
said: &#8220;Long live his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the King&#8217;s roses in her arms; the Duke&#8217;s roses, she
tossed upon the floor.</p>

<p>The manager awoke as from a trance. &#8220;You will not believe me,&#8221; he
said to Buckingham, confidently. &#8220;Here comes the arbiter of your woes, my
lord.&#8221; He arose quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be hard, methinks, sir, to decide between a coronet and a
player&#8217;s tinsel crown,&#8221; observed his princely rival, with a sneer,
as he too arose and assumed an attitude of waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care, my lord. I may forget&#8211;&#8221; Hart&#8217;s fingers
played upon his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your occupation, sir?&#8221; jeered Buckingham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye; my former occupation of a soldier&#8221;; and Hart&#8217;s sword
sprang from its <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
scabbard, with a dexterity that proved that he had not forgotten the trick of
war.</p>

<p>Buckingham too would have drawn, but a merry voice stayed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, gentlemen?&#8221; sprang from Nell&#8217;s rosy lips, as she
came between them, a picture of roguish beauty.</p>

<p>Hart&#8217;s pose in an instant was that of apology. &#8220;Pardon,
Nell,&#8221; he exclaimed, lifting his hat and bowing in courtly fashion.
&#8220;A small difference of opinion; naught else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Between friends,&#8221; replied Nell, reprovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Gods,&#8221; cried Buckingham,&#8211;and his hat too was in the
air and his knee too was bent before the theatre-queen,&#8211;&#8220;the rewards
are worth more than word-combats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said Nell, as she hugged the King&#8217;s roses tighter
in her arms. &#8220;True Englishmen fight shoulder to shoulder, not face to
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this case,&#8221; replied his lordship, with the air of a
conqueror, &#8220;the booty cannot be amicably distributed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>&#8220;Oh,
ho!&#8221; cried Nell. &#8220;Brave generals, quarrelling over the spoils. Pooh!
There is no girl worth fighting for&#8211;that is, not over one! Buckingham!
Jack! For shame! What coquette kindles this hot blood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fairest maid in England,&#8221; said Hart, with all the
earnestness of conviction, and with all the courtesy of the theatre, which
teaches courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dearest girl in all this world,&#8221; said Buckingham as quickly;
for he too must bow if he would win.</p>

<p>&#8220;How stupid!&#8221; lisped Nell, with a look of baby-innocence.
&#8220;You must mean me! Who else could answer the description? A quarrel over
poor me! This is delicious. I love a fight. Out with your swords and to&#8217;t
like men! To the victor! Come, name the quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This player&#8211;&#8221; began his lordship, hotly. He caught the
quick gleam in Nell&#8217;s eyes and hesitated. &#8220;I mean,&#8221; he
substituted, apologetically, &#8220;Master Hart&#8211;labours under the
misapprehension that you sup with him to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell,&#8221; asserted the manager, defensively, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span> &#8220;it is his lordship who suffers
from the delusion that the first actress of England sups with him
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My arm and coach are yours, madame,&#8221; pleaded his lordship, as he
gallantly offered an arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, my lord; Nell, my arm!&#8221; said Hart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heyday!&#8221; cried the witch, bewitchingly. &#8220;Was ever maid so
nobly squired? This is an embarrassment of riches.&#8221; She looked longingly
at the two attending gallants. There was something in her voice that might be
mockery or that might be love. Only the devil in her eyes could tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, you tear my heart-strings,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;How
can I choose between such loves? To-night, I sup at Whitehall!&#8221; and she
darted quickly toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whitehall!&#8221; the rivals cried, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, Whitehall&#8211;<i>with the King</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a wild, hilarious laugh, and she was gone.</p>

<p>Buckingham and Hart stood looking <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_86'></a>86</span> into each other&#8217;s face. They heard the sound of
coach-wheels rapidly departing in the street.</p>

kisses.</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>A year and more had flown.</p>

<p>It was one of those glorious moon-lit nights in the early fall when there is
a crispness in the air which lends an edge to life.</p>

<p>St. James&#8217;s Park was particularly beautiful. The giant oaks with their
hundreds of years of story written in their rings lifted high their spreading
branches, laden with leaves, which shimmered in the light. The historic old park
seemed to be made up of patches of day and night. In the open, one might read in
the mellow glow of the harvest-moon; in the shade of one of its oaks, a thief
might safely hide.</p>

<p>Facing on the park, there stood a house of Elizabethan architecture. Along
its wrinkled, ivy-mantled wall ran a terrace-like balustrade, where one might
walk and enjoy the night without fear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>The house was well
defined by the rays of the moon, which seemed to dance upon it in a halo of
mirth; and from the park, below the terrace, came the soft notes of a violin,
tenderly picked.</p>

<p>None other than Strings was sitting astride of a low branch of an oak,
looking up at a window, like some guardian spirit from the devil-land, singing
in his quaintly unctuous way:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;Four and twenty fiddlers all in a row,<br /> And there was
fiddle-fiddle, and twice fiddle-fiddle.&#8221;</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a serenade to Mistress Nell?&#8221; he asked
himself as he secured a firm footing on the ground and slung his fiddle over his
back. &#8220;She don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s for her, but the old viol and old
Strings know.&#8221; He came to a stand-still and winced. &#8220;Oons, my old
wound again,&#8221; he said, with a sharp cry, followed as quickly by a laugh.
His eyes still wandered along the balustrade, as eagerly as some young Romeo at
the balcony of his Juliet. &#8220;I wish she&#8217;d walk her terrace<span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span> to-night,&#8221; he sighed,
&#8220;where we could see her&#8211;the lovely lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>His rhapsody was suddenly broken in upon by the approach of some one down the
path. He glided into the shadow of an oak and none too quickly.</p>

<p>From the obscurity of the trees, into the open, a chair was swiftly borne, by
the side of which ran a pretty page of tender years, yet well schooled in
courtly wisdom. The lovely occupant leaned forward and motioned to the chairmen,
who obediently rested and assisted her to alight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Retire beneath the shadow of the trees,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Have a care; no noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chairmen withdrew quietly, but within convenient distance, to await her
bidding.</p>

<p>Strings&#8217;s heart quite stopped beating. &#8220;The Duchess of Portsmouth
at Mistress Nell&#8217;s!&#8221; he said, almost aloud in his excitement.
&#8220;Then the devil must be to pay!&#8221; and he slipped well behind the
oak-trunk again.</p>

<p>Portsmouth&#8217;s eyes snapped with French <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_90'></a>90</span> fire as she glanced up at Nell&#8217;s terrace. Then
she turned to the page by her side. &#8220;His Majesty came this path
before?&#8221; she asked, with quick, French accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your grace,&#8221; replied the page.</p>

<p>&#8220;And up this trellis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell, your grace,&#8221; replied the lad. &#8220;I followed
as you bade me; but the King&#8217;s legs were so long, you see, I lost
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth smiled. &#8220;Softly, pretty one,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Watch
if he comes and warn me; for we may have passed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad ran gaily down the path to perform her bidding.</p>

<p>&#8220;State-business!&#8221; she muttered, as she reflected bitterly upon
the King&#8217;s late excuses to her. &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, does he think me a
country wench? I was schooled at Louis&#8217;s court.&#8221; Her eyes searched
the house from various points of advantage. &#8220;A light!&#8221; she
exclaimed, as a candle burned brightly from a window, like a spark of gold set
in the silver of the night. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> &#8220;Would I had an invisible cloak.&#8221; She
tiptoed about a corner of the wall&#8211;woman-like, to see if she could see,
not Nell, but Charles.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she disappeared when a second figure started up in the
moonlight, and a gallant figure, too. It was the Duke of Buckingham. &#8220;Not
a mouse stirring,&#8221; he reflected, glancing at the terrace. &#8220;Fair
minx, you will not long refuse Buckingham&#8217;s overtures. Come, Nelly, thy
King is already half stolen away by Portsmouth of France, and Portsmouth of
France is our dear ally in the great cause and shall be more so.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his astonishment, as he drew nearer, he observed a lady, richly dressed,
gliding between himself and the terrace. He rubbed his eyes to see that he was
not dreaming. She was there, however, and a pretty armful, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell,&#8221; he chuckled, as he stole up behind her.</p>

<p>Portsmouth meanwhile had learned that the window was too high to allow her to
gain a view within the dwelling. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_92'></a>92</span> She started&#8211;observing, more by intuition than
by sight, that she was watched&#8211;and drew her veil closely about her
handsome features.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nelly, Nelly,&#8221; laughed Buckingham, &#8220;I have thee, wench.
Come, a kiss!&#8211;a kiss! Nay, love; it was never treason to steal a
King&#8217;s kisses.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized her by the arm and was about to kiss her when she turned and threw
back her veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buckingham!&#8221; she said, suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Portsmouth!&#8221; he exclaimed, awestruck.</p>

<p>He gathered himself together, however, in an instant, and added, as if
nothing in the world had happened: &#8220;An unexpected pleasure, your
grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she, with a pretty shrug. &#8220;I did not know I was
so honoured, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or you would not have refused the little kiss?&#8221; he asked,
suggestively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You called me &#8216;Nelly,&#8217; my lord. I do not respond to that
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damme, I was never good at names, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_93'></a>93</span> Louise,&#8221; said he, with mock-apology,
&#8220;especially by moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buz, buz!&#8221; she answered, with a knowing gesture and a knowing
look. Then, pointing toward the terrace, she added: &#8220;A pretty nest! A
pretty bird within, I warrant. Her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ignorance well feigned,&#8221; he thought. He replied, however, most
graciously: &#8220;Nell Gwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho! The King&#8217;s favourite, who has more power, they say, than
great statesmen&#8211;like my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her speech was well defined to draw out his lordship; but he was wary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless my lord is guided by my lady, as formerly,&#8221; he replied,
diplomatically.</p>

<p>A look of suspicion crept into Portsmouth&#8217;s face: but it was not
visible for want of contrast; for all things have a perverted look by the light
of the moon.</p>

<p>She had known Buckingham well at Dover. Their interests there had been one in
securing privileges from England for her French King. Both had been well
rewarded too for their pains. There were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_94'></a>94</span> no proofs, however, of this; and where his lordship
stood to-day, and which cause he would espouse, she did not know. His eyes at
Dover had fallen fondly upon her, but men&#8217;s eyes fall fondly upon many
women, and she would not trust too much until she knew more.</p>

<p>&#8220;My chairmen have set me down at the wrong door-step,&#8221; she said,
most sweetly. &#8220;My lord longs for his kiss. <i>Au revoir!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She bowed and turned to depart.</p>

<p>Buckingham was alert in an instant. He knew not when the opportunity might
come again to deal so happily with Louis&#8217;s emissary and the place and time
of meeting had its advantages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prythee stay, Duchess. I left the merry hunters, returning from
Hounslow Heath, all in Portsmouth&#8217;s interest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is
this to be my thanks?&#8221;</p>

<p>She approached him earnestly. &#8220;My lord must explain. I am stupid in
fitting English facts to English words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten Dover?&#8221; he asked, intensely, but subdued in
voice, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> &#8220;and my
pledges sworn to?&#8211;the treaty at the Castle?&#8211;the Duchess of
Orléans?&#8211;the Grand Monarch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; exclaimed Portsmouth, clutching his arm and looking
cautiously about.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my services to you there were known,&#8221; he continued,
excitedly, &#8220;and to the great cause&#8211;the first step in making England
pensioner of France and Holland the vassal of Louis&#8211;my head would pay the
penalty. Can you not trust me still?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are on strange ground to-night,&#8221; suggested Portsmouth,
tossing her head impatiently to indicate the terrace, as she tried to fathom the
real man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the King might pass this way, and came to see,&#8221;
hastily explained his lordship, observing that she was reflecting upon the
incongruity of his friendship for her and of his visit to Madame Gwyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he did?&#8221; she asked, dubiously, not seeing the
connection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan to make his visits less <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_96'></a>96</span> frequent, Louise,&#8211;for your sweet sake and
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was becoming master. He had pleased her, and she was beginning to
believe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; she said, in a way which might mean anything, but
certainly that she was listening, and intently listening too.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have servants you can trust?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; she replied as quickly; and she gloried in the thought
that some at least were as faithful as Louis&#8217;s court afforded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must watch Nell&#8217;s terrace here, night and day,&#8221; he
almost commanded in his eagerness, &#8220;who comes out, who goes in and the
hour. She may forget her royal lover; and&#8211;well&#8211;we shall have
witnesses in waiting. We owe this kindness&#8211;to his Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth shrugged her shoulders impatiently. &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&#8221;
she said. &#8220;My servants have watched, my lord, already. The despatches
would have been signed <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_97'></a>97</span> and Louis&#8217;s army on the march against the
Dutch but for this vulgar player-girl, whom I have never seen. The King forgets
all else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beautiful Duchess was piqued, indeed, that the English King should be so
swayed. She felt that it was a personal disgrace&#8211;an insult to her charms
and to her culture. She felt that the court knew it and laughed, and she feared
that Louis soon would know. Nell Gwyn! How she hated her&#8211;scarce less than
she loved Louis and her France.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be of good cheer,&#8221; suggested Buckingham, soothingly; and he half
embraced her. &#8220;My messenger shall await your signal, to carry the news to
Louis and his army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no news,&#8221; replied she, and turned upon him bitterly.
&#8220;Charles evades me. Promise after promise to sup with me broken. I
expected him to-night. My spies warned me he would not come; that he is
hereabouts again. I followed myself to see. I have the papers with me always. If
I can but see the King alone, it will <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_98'></a>98</span> not take long to dethrone this up-start queen;
wine, sweet words&#8211;England&#8217;s sign-manual.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a confident smile on her lips as she reflected upon her personal
powers, which had led Louis XIV. of France to entrust a great mission to her.
His lordship saw his growing advantage. He would make the most of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the last event you have the ball!&#8221; he suggested,
hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, and we shall be prepared,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;But Louis is
impatient to strike the blow for Empire unhampered by British sympathy for the
Dutch, and the ball is&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fortnight off,&#8221; interrupted Buckingham, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my messenger should be gone to-night,&#8221; she continued,
irritably. She approached him and whispered cautiously: &#8220;I have to-day
received another note from Bouillon. Louis relies upon me to win from Charles
his consent to the withdrawal of the British troops from Holland. This will
insure the fall of Luxembourg&#8211;the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_99'></a>99</span> key to our success. You see, Buckingham, I must not
fail. England&#8217;s debasement shall be won.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a whistle down the path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one comes!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;My chair!&#8221;</p>

<p>The page, who had given the signal, came running to her. Her chairmen too
were prompt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Join me,&#8221; she whispered to Buckingham, as he assisted her to her
seat within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Later, Louise, later,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I must back to the
neighbouring inn, before the huntsmen miss me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth waved to the chairmen, who moved silently away among the
trees.</p>

<p>Buckingham stood looking after them, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;King Charles, a French girl from Louis&#8217;s court will give me the
keys to England&#8217;s heart and her best honours,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>He glanced once again quickly at the windows of the house, and then, with
altered purpose, swaggered away down a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span> side path. He was well pleased with his thoughts,
well pleased with his chance interview with the beautiful Duchess and well
pleased with himself. His brain wove and wove moonbeam webs of intrigue as he
passed through the light and shadow of the night, wherein he would lend a
helping hand to France and secure gold and power for his pains. He had no qualms
of conscience; for must not his estates be kept, his dignity maintained? His
purpose was clear. He would bring Portsmouth and the King closer together: and
what England lost, he would gain&#8211;and, therefore, England; for was not he
himself a part of England, and a great part?</p>

<p>Then too he must and would have Nell.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>As often happens in life, when one suitor departs, another suitor knocks; and
so it happened on this glorious night. The belated suitor was none other than
Charles, the Stuart King. He seemed in the moonlight the picture of royalty, of
romance, of dignity, of carelessness, of indifference&#8211;the royal vagabond
of wit, of humour and of love. A well-thumbed &#8220;Hudibras&#8221; bulged from
his pocket. He was alone, save for some pretty spaniels that played about him.
He heeded them not. His thoughts were of Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Methought I heard voices tuned to love,&#8221; he mused, as he glanced
about. &#8220;What knave has spied out the secret of her bower? Ho, Rosamond, my
Rosamond! Why came I here again to-night? What is there in this girl, this Nell?
And <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> yet her eyes,
how like the pretty maid&#8217;s who passed me the cup that day at the cottage
where we rested. Have I lived really to love&#8211;I, Solomon&#8217;s rival in
the entertainment of the fair,&#8211;to have my heart-strings torn by this
roguish player?&#8221;</p>

<p>His reflections were broken in upon by the hunters&#8217; song in the
distance. The music was so in harmony with the night that the forest seemed
enchanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush; music!&#8221; he exclaimed, softly, as he lent himself
reluctantly to the spell, which pervaded everything as in a fairyland.
&#8220;Odds, moonlight was once for me as well the light for revels, bacchanals
and frolics; yet now I linger another evening by Nell&#8217;s terrace, mooning
like a lover o&#8217;er the memory of her eyes and entranced by the
hunters&#8217; song.&#8221;</p>

<p>The singers were approaching. The King stepped quickly beneath the trellis,
in an angle of the wall, and waited. Their song grew richer, as melodious as the
night, but it struck a discord in his soul. He was thinking of a pair of
eyes.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/nell-102.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;Cease
those discordant jangles,&#8221; he exclaimed impatiently to himself;
&#8220;cease, I say! No song except for Nell! Nell! Pour forth your sweetest
melody for Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>The hunters stopped as by intuition before the terrace. A goodly company they
were, indeed; there were James and Rochester and others of the court returning
from the day&#8217;s hunt. There was Buckingham too, who had rejoined them as
they left the inn. The music died away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose voice was that?&#8221; asked James, as he caught the sound of
the King&#8217;s impatient exclamation from the corner of the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some dreamer of the night,&#8221; laughed Buckingham. &#8220;Yon
love-sick fellow, methinks,&#8221; he continued, pointing to a figure, well
aloof beneath the trees, who was watching the scene most jealously. It was none
other than Hart, who rarely failed to have an eye on Nell&#8217;s terrace and
who instantly stole away in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the home of Eleanor Gwyn we are passing,&#8221; said
Rochester, superfluously; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_104'></a>104</span> for all knew full well that it was Nelly&#8217;s
terrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;The love-lorn seer is wise,&#8221; cried the Duke of York, quite
forgetting his frigid self as he bethought him of Nell, and becoming quite
lover-like, as he, sighing, said: &#8220;It were well to make peace with Nelly.
Sing, hunters, sing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The command was quickly obeyed and the voices well attuned; for none were
there but worshipped Nelly.</p>

<p>The King heard the serenade to the end, then stepped gaily from his
hiding-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother James under Nelly&#8217;s window!&#8221; he said, with a merry
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King!&#8221; exclaimed James, in startled accents, as he realized
the presence of his Majesty and the awkward position in which he and his
followers were placed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King!&#8221; repeated the courtiers. Hats were off and knees were
bent respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; saluted Charles, as he embraced the Duke of York
good-naturedly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>Buckingham
withdrew a few steps. He was the most disturbed at the presence of the King at
Nelly&#8217;s bower. &#8220;As I feared,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Devil take
his Majesty&#8217;s meandering heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish,&#8221; laughed Charles, &#8220;we must guard our Nelly, or
James and his saintly followers will rob her bower by moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of York assumed a devout and dignified mien. &#8220;Sire,&#8221; he
attempted to explain, but was interrupted quickly by his Majesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No apologies, pious brother. God never damned a man for a little
irregular pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a tittering among the courtiers as the King&#8217;s words fell upon
their ears.</p>

<p>James continued to apologize. &#8220;In faith, we were simply
passing&#8211;&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Again he was interrupted by his Majesty, who was in the best of humour and
much pleased at the discomfiture of his over-religious brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lorenzo too was simply passing,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span> he observed, &#8220;but the fair
Jessica and some odd ducats stuck to his girdle; and the Jew will still be
tearing his hair long after we are dust. Ah, Buckingham, they tell me you too
have a taste for roguish Nelly. Have a care!&#8221;</p>

<p>The King strode across to Buckingham as he spoke; and while there was humour
in his tone, there was injunction also.</p>

<p>Buckingham was too great a courtier not to see and feel it. He bowed
respectfully, replying to his Majesty, &#8220;Sire, I would not presume to
follow the King&#8217;s eyes, however much I admire their taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well,&#8221; replied his Majesty, pointedly, &#8220;lest they
lead thee abroad on a sleeveless mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others had travelled upon such missions; Buckingham knew it well.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does your Majesty here to-night, if we dare ask?&#8221;
questioned James, who had just bethought him how to turn the tables upon the
King.</p>

<p>Charles looked at his brother quizzically. &#8220;Humph!&#8221; he exclaimed,
in his peculiar way. &#8220;Feeding my ducks in yonder <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span> pond.&#8221; His staff swept
indefinitely toward the park.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunting with us were nobler business, Sire,&#8221; suggested James,
decisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; replied the King, quite seriously. &#8220;My
way&#8211;I learn to legislate for ducks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;T'were wiser,&#8221; preached York, &#8220;to study your
subjects&#8217; needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;I go among them,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and learn their needs, while you are praying, brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this sally, Rochester became convulsed, though he hid it well; for
Rochester was not as pious as brother James.</p>

<p>York, feeling that the sympathy was against him, grew more earnest still.
&#8220;I wish your Majesty would have more care,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
a crime against yourself, a crime against the state, a crime against the
cavaliers who fought and died for you, to walk these paths alone in such
uncertain times. Perchance, &#8217;tis courting lurking murder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No kind of danger, James,&#8221; answered the King, with equal
seriousness, laying <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_109'></a>109</span> a hand kindly on his brother&#8217;s shoulder;
&#8220;for I am sure no man in England would take away my life to make you
King.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was general laughter from the assembled party; for all dared laugh,
even at the expense of the Duke of York, when the jest was of the King&#8217;s
making. Indeed, not to laugh at a king&#8217;s jest has been in every age, in or
out of statutes, the greatest crime. Fortunately, King Charles&#8217;s wit
warranted its observation.</p>

<p>James himself grew mellow under the influence of the gaiety, and almost
affectionately replied, &#8220;God grant it be ever so, brother.&#8221; He then
turned the thought. &#8220;We heard but now an ambassador from Morocco&#8217;s
court is lately landed. He brings your Majesty two lions and thirty
ostriches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish, but he is kind,&#8221; replied the King, reflecting on the
gift. &#8220;I know of nothing more proper to send by way of return than a flock
of geese.&#8221;</p>

<p>His brow arched quizzically, as he glanced over the circle of inert courtiers
ranged about him. &#8220;Methinks I can count <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_110'></a>110</span> them out at Whitehall,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seeks an audience to-night. Will you grant it, Sire?&#8221;
besought James.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sheart!&#8221; replied the King. &#8220;Most cheerfully, I&#8217;ll
lead you from Nelly&#8217;s terrace, brother. Hey! Tune up your throats. On to
the palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The music died away among the old oaks in the park. Before its final notes
were lost on the air, however, hasty steps and a chatter of women&#8217;s voices
came from the house. The door leading to the terrace was thrown quickly open,
and Nell appeared. Her eyes had the bewildered look of one who has been suddenly
awakened from a sleep gilded with a delightful dream.</p>

<p>She had, indeed, been dreaming&#8211;dreaming of the King and of his coming.
As she lay upon her couch, where she had thrown herself after the evening meal,
she had seemed to hear his serenade.</p>

<p>Then the music ceased and she started up and rubbed her eyes. It was only to
see the moonlight falling through the latticed windows on to the floor of her
dainty <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span> chamber.
She was alone and she bethought herself sadly that dreams go by contraries.</p>

<p>Once again, however, the hunters&#8217; song had arisen on her startled
ear&#8211;and had died away in sweet cadences in the distance. It was not a
dream!</p>

<p>As she rushed out upon the terrace, she called Moll reprovingly; and, in an
instant, Moll was at her side. The faithful girl had already seen the hunters
and had started a search for Nell; but the revellers had gone before she could
find her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, dear Nell?&#8221; asked her companion, well out of
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you not call me, cruel girl?&#8221; answered Nell,
impatiently. &#8220;To miss seeing so many handsome cavaliers! Where is my
kerchief?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell leaned over the balustrade and waved wildly to the departing hunters. A
pretty picture she was too, in her white flowing gown, silvered by the
moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, see,&#8221; she exclaimed to Moll, with wild enthusiasm,
&#8220;some one waves back. It may be he, sweet mouse. Heigh-ho! Why don&#8217;t
you wave, Moll?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>Before Moll
could answer, a rich bugle-horn rang out across the park.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hunters&#8217; horn!&#8221; cried Nell, gleefully. &#8220;Oh, I
wish I were a man&#8211;except when one is with me&#8221;; and she threw both
arms about Moll, for the want of one better to embrace. She was in her varying
mood, which was one &#8217;twixt the laughter of the lip and the tear in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lost my brother!&#8221; ejaculated some one; but she heard him
not.</p>

<p>This laconic speech came from none other than the King, who in a bantering
mood had returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went one side a tree and pious James t&#8217;other; and here I am by
Nelly&#8217;s terrace once again,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Oh, ho!
wench!&#8221; His eyes had caught sight of Nell upon the terrace.</p>

<p>He stepped back quickly into the shadow and watched her playfully.</p>

<p>Nell looked longingly out into the night, and sighed heavily. She was at her
wit&#8217;s end. The evening was waning, and the King, as she thought, had not
come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you sigh?&#8221; asked Moll, consolingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8220;I was
only looking down the path, dear heart,&#8221; replied Nell, sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come,&#8221; hopefully suggested Moll, whose little heart
sympathized deeply with her benefactress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, sweet,&#8221; said Nell, and she shook her curls while the
moonbeams danced among them, &#8220;he is as false as yonder moon&#8211;as
changeable of face.&#8221;</p>

<p>She withdrew her eyes from the path and they fell upon the King. His
Majesty&#8217;s curiosity had quite over-mastered him, and he had inadvertently
stepped well into the light. The novelty of hearing himself derided by such
pretty lips was a delicious experience, indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King!&#8221; she cried, in joyous surprise.</p>

<p>Moll&#8217;s diplomatic effort to escape at the sight of his Majesty was not
half quick enough for Nell, who forthwith forced her companion into the house,
and closed the door sharply behind her, much to the delight of the humour-loving
King.</p>

<p>Nell then turned to the balustrade and, somewhat confused, looked down at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span> Majesty, who now
stood below, calmly gazing up at her, an amused expression on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, your Majesty,&#8221; she explained, falteringly, &#8220;I did
not see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You overlooked me merely,&#8221; slyly suggested Charles, swinging his
stick in the direction of the departed hunters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;faith, I thought it was you waved answer, Sire,&#8221; quickly
replied Nell, whose confusion was gone and who was now mistress of the situation
and of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Nell; I hunt alone for my hart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hunt the right park, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, a good preserve, truly,&#8221; observed the King. &#8220;I find
my game, as I expected, flirting, waving kerchiefs, making eyes and throwing
kisses to the latest passer-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was encouraging the soldiers, my liege. That is every woman&#8217;s
duty to her country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her country<i>men</i>,&#8221; said he, smiling. &#8220;You are
very loyal, Nell. Come down!&#8221; It was irritating, indeed, to be kept so at
arm&#8217;s length.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>She gazed down
at him with impish sweetness&#8211;down at the King of England!</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up!&#8221; she said, leaning over the balustrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; come down if you love me,&#8221; pleaded the King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; come up if you love me,&#8221; said Nell, enticingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Egad! I am too old to climb,&#8221; exclaimed the Merry Monarch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Egad! I am too young yet for the downward path, your Majesty,&#8221;
retorted Nell.</p>

<p>The King shrugged his shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will fall if we give you time,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the King&#8217;s level?&#8221; she asked, slyly, then answered
herself: &#8220;Mayhap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus they stood like knights after the first tilt. Charles looked up at Nell,
and Nell looked down at Charles. There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Nell broke
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am surprised you happen this way, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>&#8220;With such
eyes to lure me?&#8221; asked the King, and he asked earnestly too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush,&#8221; answered Nell, coyly, &#8220;your tongue will lead you to
perdition, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fear!&#8221; replied he, dryly. &#8220;I knelt in church with
brother James but yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In sooth, quite true!&#8221; said Nell, approvingly, as she leaned
back against the door and raised her eyes innocently toward the moon. &#8220;I
sat in the next pew, Sire, afraid to move for fear I might awake your
Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King chuckled softly to himself. Nell picked one of the flowers that grew
upon the balustrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you come a long-forgotten path to-night,&#8221; she said
abruptly.</p>

<p>The King was alert in an instant. He felt that he had placed himself in a
false light. He loved the witch above despite himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw thee twa evenings ago, lass,&#8221; he hastily asserted, in good
Scotch accents, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is not that a long time, Sire,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span> questioned Nell, &#8220;or did
Portsmouth make it fly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Portsmouth!&#8221; exclaimed Charles. He turned his face away.
&#8220;Can it be my conscience pricks me?&#8221; he thought. &#8220;You know
more of her than I, sweet Nell,&#8221; he then asserted, with open manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, I know her not at all and never saw her,&#8221; said Nell.
&#8220;I shall feel better when I do,&#8221; she thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It were well for England&#8217;s peace you have not met,&#8221;
laughed Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith and troth,&#8221; said Nell, &#8220;I am happy to know our King
has lost his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odso! And why?&#8221; asked Charles; and he gazed at Nell in his
curious uncertain way, as he thought it was never possible to tell quite what
she meant or what she next would think or say or do.</p>

<p>&#8220;We feared he had not one to lose,&#8221; she slyly suggested.
&#8220;It gives us hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To have it in another&#8217;s hand as you allege?&#8221; asked
Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, truly!&#8221; answered Nell, decisively. &#8220;The Duchess may
find it more <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span> than
she can hold and toss it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, wench!&#8221; exclaimed the King, with assumption of wounded
dignity. &#8220;My heart a ball for women to bat about!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire, two women often play at rackets even with a king&#8217;s
heart,&#8221; softly suggested Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish,&#8221; cried the King, with hands and eyes raised in mock
supplication. &#8220;Heaven help me then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the hunters&#8217; horn rang clearly on the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The horn! The horn!&#8221; said Nell, with forced indifference.
&#8220;They call you, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a triumphantly bewitching look in her eyes, however, as she
realized the discomfiture of the King. He was annoyed, indeed. His manner
plainly betokened his desire to stay and his irritation at the interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis so!&#8221; he said at last, resignedly. &#8220;The King is
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horn sounded clearer. The hunters were returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again&#8211;nearer!&#8221; exclaimed Charles, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span> fretfully. His mind reverted to his
pious brother; and he laughed as he continued: &#8220;Poor brother James and his
ostriches!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could almost touch Nell&#8217;s finger-tips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farewell, sweet,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I must help them find his
Majesty or they will swarm here like bees. Yet I must see my Nell again
to-night. You have bewitched me, wench. Sup with me within the
hour&#8211;at&#8211;Ye Blue Boar Inn. Can you find the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was mischief in Nell&#8217;s voice as she leaned upon the balustrade.
She dropped a flower; he caught it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire, I can always find a rendezvous,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the biggest rogue in England,&#8221; laughed Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of a <i>subject</i>, perhaps, Sire,&#8221; replied Nell,
pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is treason, sly wench,&#8221; rejoined the King; but his voice
grew tender as he added: &#8220;but treason of the tongue and not the heart.
Adieu! Let that seal thy lips, until we meet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>He threw a kiss
to the waiting lips upon the balcony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alack-a-day,&#8221; sighed Nell, sadly, as she caught the kiss.
&#8220;Some one may break the seal, my liege; who knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How now?&#8221; questioned Charles, jealously.</p>

<p>Nell hugged herself as she saw his fitful mood; for beneath mock jealousy she
thought she saw the germ of true jealousy. She laughed wistfully as she
explained: &#8220;It were better to come up and seal them tighter,
Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Minx!&#8221; he chuckled, and tossed another kiss.</p>

<p>The horn again echoed through the woods. He started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll despatch the affairs of England, brother; then
we&#8217;ll sup with pretty Nelly. Poor brother James! Heaven bless him and his
ostriches.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and strode quickly through the trees and down the path; but, as he
went, ever and anon he called: &#8220;Ye Blue Boar Inn, within the
hour!&#8221;</p>

<p>Each time from the balcony in Nell&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_122'></a>122</span> sweet voice came back&#8211;&#8220;Ye Blue Boar
Inn, within the hour! I will not fail you, Sire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she too disappeared. There was again a slamming of doors and much
confusion within the house. There were calls and sounds of running feet.</p>

<p>The door below the terrace opened suddenly, and Nell appeared breathless upon
the lawn&#8211;at her heels the constant Moll. Nell ran some steps down the
path, peering vainly through the woods after the departing King. Her bosom rose
and fell in agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Moll, Moll, Moll!&#8221; she exclaimed, fearfully. &#8220;He has
been at Portsmouth&#8217;s since high noon. I could see it in his eyes.&#8221;
Her own eyes snapped as she thought of the hated French rival, whom she had not
yet seen, but whose relation to the royal household, as she thought, gave her
the King&#8217;s ear almost at will.</p>

<p>She walked nervously back and forth, then turned quickly upon her companion,
asking her, who knew nothing, a hundred questions, all in one little breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span> &#8220;What is
she? How looks she? What is her charm, her fascination, the magic of her art? Is
she short, tall, fat, lean, joyous or sombre? I must know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Nell, what will you do?&#8221; cried Moll in fearful accents as
she watched her beautiful mistress standing passion-swayed before her like a
queen in the moonlight, the little toe of her slipper nervously beating the
sward as she general-like marshalled her wits for the battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;See her, see her,&#8211;from top to toe!&#8221; Nell at length
exclaimed. &#8220;Oh, there will be sport, sweet mouse. France again against
England&#8211;the stake, a King!&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced in the direction of the house and cried joyously as she saw
Strings hobbling toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven ever gave me a man in waiting,&#8221; she said, gleefully.
&#8220;Poor fellow, he limps from youthful, war-met wounds. Comrade, are you
still strong enough for service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the death for you, Mistress Nell!&#8221; he faithfully replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the Duchess of Portsmouth, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_124'></a>124</span> and where she lives?&#8221; artfully inquired
Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Portsmouth!&#8221; he repeated, excitedly. &#8220;She was here but
now, peeping at your windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell stood aghast. Her face grew pale, and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here!&#8221; she exclaimed, incredulously. &#8220;The imported
hussy!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned hotly upon Strings, as she had upon poor Moll, with an array of
questions which almost paralyzed the old fiddler&#8217;s wits. &#8220;How looks
she? What colour eyes? Does her lip arch? How many inches span her
waist?&#8221;</p>

<p>Strings looked cautiously about, then whispered in Nell&#8217;s ear. He might
as well have talked to all London; for Nell, in her excitement, repeated his
words at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You overheard? Great Heavens! Drug the King and win the rights of
England while he is in his cups? Bouillon&#8211;the army&#8211;Louis&#8211;the
Dutch! A conspiracy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear; oh, dear,&#8221; came from Moll&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span> trembling lips.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s wits were like lightning playing with the clouds. Her plans were
formed at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fly, fly, comrade,&#8221; she commanded Strings. &#8220;Overtake her
chair. Tell the Duchess that her beloved Charles&#8211;she will
understand&#8211;entreats her to sup at Ye Blue Boar Inn, within the hour. Nay,
she will be glad enough to come. Say he awaits her alone. Run, run, good
Strings, and you shall have a hospital to nurse these wounds, as big as
Noah&#8217;s ark; and the King shall build it for the message.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strings hastened down the path, fired by Nell&#8217;s inspiration, with
almost the eagerness of a boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, run!&#8221; cried Nell, in ecstasy, as she looked after him and
dwelt gleefully upon the outcome of her plans.</p>

<p>He disappeared through the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigh-ho!&#8221; she said, with a light-hearted step. &#8220;Now,
Moll, we&#8217;ll get our first sight of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted into the house, dragging poor Moll after her.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>&#8220;And the man that is drunk is as great as a
king.&#8221;</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>An old English inn! What spot on earth is more hospitable, even though its
floor be bare and its tables wooden? There is a homely atmosphere about it, with
its cobwebbed rafters, its dingy windows, its big fireplace, where the rough
logs crackle, and its musty ale. It has ever been a home for the belated
traveller, where the viands, steaming hot, have filled his soul with joy. Oh,
the Southdown mutton and the roasts of beef!</p>

<p>If England has given us naught else, she should be beloved for her wealth of
inns, with their jolly landlords and their pert bar-maids and their lawns for
the game of bowls. May our children&#8217;s children find them still
unchanged.</p>

<p>In a quaint corner of London, there stood such an inn, in the days of which
we speak; and it lives in our story. When <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_127'></a>127</span> it was built, no one knew and none cared. Tradition
said that it had been a rendezvous for convivial spirits for ages that had gone.
A sign hung from the door, on which was a boar&#8217;s head; and under it, in
Old English lettering, might have been deciphered, if the reader had the wit to
read, &#8220;Ye Blue Boar Inn.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the evening of a certain day, known to us all, in the reign of good
King Charles. Three yesty spirits sat convivially enjoying the warmth of the
fire upon the huge hearth. A keg was braced in the centre of the room. One of
the merry crew&#8211;none other, indeed, than Swallow, a constable to the
King&#8211;sat astride the cask, Don Quixote-like. In place of the dauntless
lance, he was armed with a sturdy mug of good old ale. He sang gaily to a tune
of his own, turning ever and anon for approbation to Buzzard, another spirit of
like guild, who sat in a semi-maudlin condition by the table, and also to the
moon-faced landlord of the inn, who encouraged the joviality of his
guests&#8211;not forgetting to count <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_128'></a>128</span> the cups which they demolished.</p>

<p>Swallow sang:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a health unto his Majesty, with a fa, la, fa,<br />
Conversion to his enemies with a fa, la, fa,<br /> And he that will not pledge
his health,<br /> I wish him neither wit nor wealth,<br /> Nor yet a rope to
hang himself&#8211;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fa, la,
fa,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a
fa, la, fa.&#8221;</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>The song ended in a triumphant wave of glory. The singer turned toward the
fellow, Buzzard, and demanded indignantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t ye sing, knave, to the tune of the spigot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My gullet&#8217;s dry, Master Constable,&#8221; stupidly explained his
companion, as he too buried his face in the ale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsbud, thou knowest not the art, thou clod,&#8221; retorted the
constable, wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; I can sing as well as any man,&#8221; answered Buzzard,
indignantly, &#8220;an I know when to go up and when to come down.&#8221; He
pointed stupidly, contrary to the phrase, first to the floor and then to the
ceiling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>The landlord
chuckled merrily, imitating him. &#8220;When to go up and when to come
down!&#8221; he repeated with the same idiotic drawl and contradictory
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to, simple,&#8221; replied Swallow, with tremendous condescension
of manner. &#8220;Thy mother gave thee a gullet but no ear. Pass the
schnapps.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose and staggered to the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Master Constable, how singest thou?&#8221; sheepishly inquired
Buzzard, as he filled Swallow&#8217;s tankard for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, by main force, thou jack-pudding; how else?&#8221; demanded
Swallow, pompously. He reseated himself with much effort astride the cask.
&#8220;Oh, bury me here,&#8221; he continued, looking into the foaming mug, and
then buried his face deep in the ale.</p>

<p>His companions were well pleased with the toast; for each repeated it after
him, each in his turn emphasizing the &#8220;me&#8221; and the
&#8220;here&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;Oh, bury <i>me here!&#8221;</i> &#8220;Oh, bury
<i>me here!</i>&#8221;&#8211;Buzzard in a voice many tones deeper than that of
Swallow <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span> and the
landlord in a voice many tones deeper than that of Buzzard. Indeed, the guttural
tones of the landlord bespoke the grave-yard.</p>

<p>The three faces were lost in the foam; the three sets of lips smacked in
unison; and the world might have wagged as it would for these three jolly topers
but for a woman&#8217;s voice, calling sharply from the kitchen:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenkins, love!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Body o&#8217; me!&#8221; exclaimed the landlord, almost dropping his
empty tankard. &#8220;Coming, coming, my dear!&#8221; and he departed
hastily.</p>

<p>The constable poked Buzzard in the ribs; Buzzard poked the constable in the
ribs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jenkins, love!&#8221; they exclaimed in one breath as the landlord
returned, much to his discomfiture; and their eyes twinkled and wrinkled as they
poked fun at the taverner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Body o&#8217; me! Thou sly dog!&#8221; said the constable, as he
continued to twit him. &#8220;Whence came the saucy wench in <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span> the kitchen, landlord? A
dimpled cook, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord&#8217;s face grew serious with offended dignity as he attempted
to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis my wife, Master Constable,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, the new one?&#8221; inquired Swallow.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not the old one, Master Swallow,&#8221; replied the old
hypocrite, wiping away a forced tear. &#8220;Poor soul, she&#8217;s gone, I know
not where.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217; faith, I trow she&#8217;s still cooking, landlord,&#8221;
consolingly replied the constable, with tearful mien, pointing slyly downward
for the benefit of Buzzard and steadying himself with difficulty on the
cask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless Matilde,&#8221; said the landlord as he wiped his eyes again,
&#8220;I had a hard time to fill her place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, truly,&#8221; chuckled Swallow in Buzzard&#8217;s ear, between
draughts, &#8220;three long months from grave to altar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good soul, a good soul, Master <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_132'></a>132</span> Swallow,&#8221; continued the landlord, with the
appearance of deep affliction.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a better cook, landlord,&#8221; said Swallow, sadly.
&#8220;Odsbud, she knew a gooseberry tart. Patch your old wife&#8217;s soul to
your new wife&#8217;s face, and you&#8217;ll be a happy man, landlord.
Here&#8217;s a drop to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank ye, Master Constable,&#8221; replied the landlord, much
affected. He looked well to the filling of the flagon in his hand, again wiped a
tear from his eye and took a deep draught to the pledge of</p>

<p>&#8220;The old one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Swallow, with equal reverence, and with some diplomacy, placed his flagon to
his lips with the pledge of</p>

<p>&#8220;The new one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buzzard, who had not been heard from for some time, roused sufficiently to
realize the situation, and broke out noisily on his part with</p>

<p>&#8220;The next one!&#8221;</p>

<p>A startled expression pervaded the landlord&#8217;s face as he realized the
meaning of Buzzard&#8217;s words. He glanced woefully <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span> toward the kitchen-door, lest the new
wife might have overheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, Buzzard!&#8221; Swallow hastened to command, reprovingly.
&#8220;Would ye raise a man&#8217;s dead wife? Learn discretion from thy elders,
an thou hop&#8217;st to be a married man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, I do not hope,&#8221; declared Buzzard, striking the table with
his clenched hand. He had no time for matrimony while the cups were
overflowing.</p>

<p>There was a quick, imperative knock at the door. The constable, Buzzard and
the landlord, all started up in confusion and fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thieves,&#8221; stammered Swallow, faintly, from behind the cask, from
which he had dismounted at the first sign of danger. &#8220;They are making off
with thy tit-bit-of-a-wife, landlord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be there thieves in the neighbourhood, Master Constable?&#8221;
whispered the landlord, in consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should his Majesty&#8217;s constable be here else?&#8221; said
Swallow, reaching for a pike, which trembled in his hand as if <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span> he had the ague.
&#8220;The country about&#8217;s o&#8217;er-run with them; and I warrant
&#8217;tis thy new wife&#8217;s blue eyes they are after.&#8221; He steadied
himself with the pike and took a deep draught of ale to steady his courage as
well.</p>

<p>Buzzard started to crawl beneath the table, but the wary constable caught him
by his belt and made a shield for the nonce of his trembling body.</p>

<p>The landlord&#8217;s eyes bulged from their sockets as if a spirit from the
nether regions had confronted him. The corners of his mouth, which ascended in
harmony with his moon-face, twitched nervously. &#8220;Mercy me, sayest thou
so?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;And in thine ear,&#8221; continued Swallow, consolingly, &#8220;and if
thou see&#8217;st Old Rowley within a ten league, put thy new huswife&#8217;s face
under lock and key and Constable Swallow on the door to guard thy
treasure.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i7'></a><img src='images/nell-135.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
MISTRESS NELL FINDS HAPPINESS.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>It was not quite
clear, however, what the constable meant; for &#8220;Old Rowley&#8221; was the
name of the King&#8217;s favourite racehorse, of Newmarket fame, and had also
come to be the nickname of the King himself. Charles assumed it good-naturedly.
Assuredly, neither might be expected as a visitor to Ye Blue Boar.</p>

<p>There came a more spirited knock at the door. The constable sought a niche in
the fireplace, whence he endeavoured to exclude Buzzard, who was loath to be
excluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pass the Dutch-courage, good landlord,&#8221; entreated Swallow, in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>The landlord started boldly toward the door, but his courage failed him.
&#8220;Go thou, Master Constable,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go thou thyself,&#8221; wisely commanded Swallow, with the appearance
of much bravery, though one eye twitched nervously in the direction of the
kitchen-door in the rear, as a possible means of exit. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
need of his Majesty&#8217;s constable till the battery be complete. There must
be an action and intent, saith the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Rowley!&#8221; muttered the landlord, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span> fearfully. &#8220;Good Master
Constable&#8211;&#8221; he pleaded. His face, which was usually like a roast of
beef, grew livid with fear.</p>

<p>Swallow, however, gave him no encouragement, and the landlord once more
started for the door.</p>

<p>On the way his eye lighted on a full cask which was propped up in the corner.
Instinct was strong in him, even in death. It had been tapped, and it would be
unsafe to leave it even for an instant within reach of such guests. He stopped
and quickly replaced the spigot with a plug.</p>

<p>There was a third knock at the door&#8211;louder than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anon, anon!&#8221; he called, hastily turning and catching up the
half-filled flagon from the table. He disappeared in the entry-way.</p>

<p>The brave representatives of the King&#8217;s law craned their necks, but
they could hear nothing. As the silence continued, courage was gradually
restored to them; and, with the return of courage, came the desire for further
drink.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>Swallow again
seized his pike and staggered toward the entry-way to impress his companion with
his bravery.</p>

<p>Buzzard caught the spirit of the action. &#8220;Marry, I&#8217;d be a
constable, too, an it were to sit by the fire and guard a pretty wench,&#8221;
he said. His face glowed in anticipation of such happiness as he glanced through
the half-open door to the kitchen, where the landlord&#8217;s wife reigned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Egad, thou a constable!&#8221; ejaculated Swallow, contemptuously,
throwing a withering glance in the direction of his comrade. &#8220;Thou
ignoramamus! Old Rowley wants naught but brave men and sober men like me to
guard the law. Thou art a drunken Roundhead. One of Old Noll&#8217;s vile
ruffians. I can tell it by the wart on thy nose, knave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Master Constable,&#8221; explained Buzzard, with an injured look
at the mention of the wart, &#8220;it will soon away. Mother says, when I was a
rosy babe, Master Wart was all in all; now I&#8217;m a man, Master Nose is
crowding Neighbour Wart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>Swallow put his
hands on his knees and laughed deeply. He contemplated the nose and person of
his companion with a curious air and grew mellow with patronage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy fool&#8217;s pate is not so dull,&#8221; he said, half aloud, as
he lighted a long pipe and puffed violently. &#8220;Thy wit would crack a
quarter-staff. &#8217;Sbud, would&#8217;st be my <i>posse?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>This was, indeed, a concession on the part of the constable, who was
over-weighted with the dignity of the law which he upheld.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would&#8217;st be at my command,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;to execute the
King&#8217;s <i>Statu quos</i> on rogues?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, Constable Buzzard!&#8221; exclaimed the toper, gleefully.
&#8220;Nay, and I would!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, &#8216;Constable&#8217; Buzzard!&#8221; replied Swallow, with
tremendous indignation at the assumption of the fellow. &#8220;Nay, and thou
would&#8217;st not, ass! By my patron saint&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>As the constable spoke, Buzzard&#8217;s eye, with a leer, lighted on the cask
in the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span> corner. He
bethought him that it had a vent-hole even though the landlord had removed the
spigot. He tiptoed unsteadily across the room, and proceeded with much
difficulty to insert a straw in the small opening. He had thus already added
materially to his maudlin condition, before Swallow discovered, with
consternation and anger, the temporary advantage which the newly appointed
<i>posse</i> had secured.</p>

<p>The cunning constable held carefully on to his tongue, however. He quietly
produced a knife and staggered in his turn to the cask, unobserved by the
unsuspecting Buzzard, whose eyes were tightly closed in the realization of a
dream of his highest earthly bliss.</p>

<p>In an instant, the straw was clipped mid-way and the constable was enjoying
the contents of the cask through the lower half, while Buzzard slowly awakened
to the fact that his dream of bliss had vanished and that he was sucking a bit
of straw which yielded naught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, knave,&#8221; commanded Swallow, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span> between breaths, pushing the other
roughly aside, &#8220;thou hast had enough for a <i>posse</i>. Fill my mug, thou
ignoranshibus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buzzard staggered toward the table to perform the bidding. &#8220;The
flagon&#8217;s empty, Master Constable,&#8221; he replied, and forthwith loudly
called out, &#8220;Landlord! Landlord!&#8221;</p>

<p>The constable dropped his straw and raised himself with difficulty to his
full height, one hand firmly resting on the cask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, fool of a <i>posse</i>&#8221; he commanded, when he had
poised himself; &#8220;look ye, I have other eggs on the spit. To thy knee,
sirrah; to thy knee, knave!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buzzard with difficulty and with many groans unsuspectingly obeyed the
command. Swallow lifted the cask which not long since he had been riding and
which had not as yet been tapped upon the shoulder of his kneeling companion.
There was another groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis too heavy, good Master Constable,&#8221; cried Buzzard, in sore
distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou clodhopper&#8217;&#8221; yelled Swallow, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span> unsympathetically. &#8220;An thou
cannot master a cask of wine, thou wilt never master the King&#8217;s law. To
the kitchen with thee; and keep thy eyes shut, thou knave of a
<i>posse</i>.&#8221; The constable made a dive for his pike and lantern, and
enforced his authority by punctuating his remarks with jabs of the pike from
behind at his powerless friend, who could scarce keep his legs under the weight
of the cask.</p>

<p>As Buzzard tottered through the kitchen-door and made his exit, the
constable, finding his orders faithfully obeyed, steadied himself with the pike
to secure a good start; and then, with long staggering strides, he himself made
his way after the <i>posse</i>, singing loudly to his heart&#8217;s content:</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>Three chickens!</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The door opened quickly, and in came King Charles; but who would have known
him? The royal monarch had assumed the mien and garb of a ragged cavalier.</p>

<p>His eyes swept the inn quickly and approvingly. He turned upon the landlord,
who followed him with dubious glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cook the chickens to a turn; and, mark you, have the turbot and sauce
hot, and plenty of wine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Look to&#8217;t; the vintage I
named, Master Landlord. I know the bouquet and sparkle and the ripple o&#8217;er
the palate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is to pay for all this, sir?&#8221; asked the landlord, aghast at
the order.</p>

<p>&#8220;Insolent!&#8221; replied Charles. &#8220;I command it,
sirrah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, sir,&#8221; humbly suggested the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span> landlord; &#8220;guineas, and not
words, command here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odso!&#8221; muttered the King, remembering his disguise. &#8220;My
temper will reveal me. Never fear, landlord,&#8221; he boasted loudly.
&#8220;You shall be paid, amply paid. I will pledge myself you shall be
paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, sir,&#8221; falteringly repeated the landlord, rubbing his
hands together graciously; &#8220;but the order is a costly one and
you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not look flourishing?&#8221; said Charles, as he laughingly
finished the sentence, glancing somewhat dubiously himself at his own dress.
&#8220;Never judge a man by his rags. Plague on&#8217;t, though; I would not
become my own creditor upon inspection. Take courage, good Master Landlord;
England&#8217;s debt is in my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many to supper, sir?&#8221; asked the landlord, fearful lest he
might offend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two! Two! Only two!&#8221; decisively exclaimed Charles. &#8220;A man
is an extravagant fool who dines more. The third is expensive and in the way.
Eh, landlord?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>The King winked
gaily at the landlord, who grinned in response and dropped his eyes more
respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two, sir,&#8221; acquiesced the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, mine host, thou art favoured beyond thy kind,&#8221; laughed
Charles, knowingly, as he dwelt upon the joys of a feast incognito alone with
Nell. &#8220;A belated goddess would sup at thy hostelry.&#8221; The
landlord&#8217;s eyes grew big with astonishment. &#8220;I will return. Obey her
every wish, dost hear, her every wish, and leave the bill religiously to
me.&#8221; Charles swaggered gaily up the steps to the entry-way and out the
door.</p>

<p>The moon-face of the inn-keeper grew slowly serious. He could not reconcile
the shabby, road-bespattered garments of the strange cavalier with his princely
commands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Body o&#8217; me!&#8221; he muttered, lighting one by one the candles
in the room, till the rafters fairly glowed in expectation of the feast.
&#8220;Roundhead-beggar, on my life! Turbot and capons and the best vintage! The
King could not have better than this <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_145'></a>145</span> rogue. Marry, he shall have the best in the larder;
but Constable Swallow shall toast his feet in the kitchen, with a mug of musty
ale to make him linger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The corners of the mouth in the moon-face ascended in a chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;His ragged lordship&#8217;ll settle the bill very religiously,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;or sleep off his swollen Roundhead behind the
bars.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed into the kitchen and gave the order for the repast. As he returned,
there was a tap at the door; and he hastened to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, a petticoat!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s told
the truth for once. She&#8217;s veiled. Ashamed of her face or ashamed of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door and ushered in a lady dressed in white; across her face
and eyes was thrown a scarf of lace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here?&#8221; questioned the new-comer, glancing eagerly about the
room and peeping into every nook and corner without the asking, to the
astonishment of the inn-keeper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;Not
here?&#8221; she asked herself again, excitedly. &#8220;Tell me, tell me, is
this Ye Blue Boar Inn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lady&#8211;&#8221; replied the landlord, graciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, good! Has she been here? Have you seen her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, the goddess?&#8221; asked the landlord, stupidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The goddess!&#8221; retorted Nell, for it was none other, with
humorous irony of lip. &#8220;How can you so belie the Duchess?&#8221; She
laughed merrily at the thought.</p>

<p>There was a second knock; and the landlord again hastened to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis she; &#8217;tis she!&#8221; exclaimed Nell, excitedly.
&#8220;Haste ye, man; I am in waiting! What has she on? How is she
dressed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Body o&#8217; me!&#8221; exclaimed the landlord, in awe, as he craned
his neck at the sash. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a lady of quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad quality,&#8221; ejaculated Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has come in a chair of silver,&#8221; cried the landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;My chair shall be of beaten gold, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_147'></a>147</span> then,&#8221; thought Nell, with a twinkle of the
eye. &#8220;Charles, you must raise the taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy me, the great lady&#8217;s coming in,&#8221; continued the
landlord, beside himself in his excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;She shall be welcome, most welcome, landlord,&#8221; observed Nell
promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Body o&#8217; me! What shall I say?&#8221; asked the landlord, in
trembling accents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith and troth,&#8221; replied Nell, coming to his rescue, &#8220;I
will do the parlez-vousing with her ladyship. Haste thee, thou grinning fat
man.&#8221; She glided quickly into a corner of the old fireplace, where she
could not be observed so readily.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Portsmouth entered, with all the haughty grandeur of a queen.
She glanced about contemptuously, and her lip could be seen to curl, even
through the veil which partially hid her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;This <i>bourgeois</i> place,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to sup with the
King! It cannot be! <i>Garçon!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a voice,&#8221; reflected Nell, in her hiding-place, &#8220;in
which to sigh, &#8216;I love you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barbarous place!&#8221; exclaimed Portsmouth. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span> &#8220;His Majesty must have lost his
wits.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled complacently, however, as she reflected that the King might
consent even within these walls and that his sign-manual, if so secured, would
be as binding as if given in a palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Garçon!</i>&#8221; again she called, irritably.</p>

<p>Nell was meanwhile inspecting her rival from top to toe. Nothing escaped her
quick eye. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wager her complexion needs a veil,&#8221; she
muttered, with vixenish glee. &#8220;That gown is an insult to her native
France.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Garçon</i>; answer me,&#8221; commanded Portsmouth, fretfully.</p>

<p>The landlord had danced about her grace in such anxiety to please that he had
displeased. He had not learned the courtier&#8217;s art of being ever present,
yet never in the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your ladyship,&#8221; he stupidly repeated again and again.
&#8220;What would your ladyship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did a prince leave commands for supper?&#8221; she asked,
impatiently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;No, your
ladyship,&#8221; he replied, obsequiously. &#8220;A ragged rogue ordered a
banquet and then ran away, your ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, sirrah?&#8221; she questioned, angrily, though the poor landlord
had meant no discourtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he knew his guests, he would ne&#8217;er return,&#8221; softly laughed
Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Parbleu</i>,&#8221; continued Portsmouth, in her French, impatient
way, now quite incensed by the stupidity of the landlord, &#8220;a cavalier
would meet me at Ye Blue Boar Inn; so said the messenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>She suddenly caught sight of Nell, whose biting curiosity had led her from
her hiding-place. &#8220;This is not the rendezvous,&#8221; she reflected
quickly. &#8220;We were to sup alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord still bowed and still uttered the meaningless phrase:
&#8220;Yes, your ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess was at the end of her patience. &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu</i>,&#8221;
she exclaimed, &#8220;do you know nothing, sirrah?&#8221;</p>

<p>The moon-face beamed. The head <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span> bowed and bowed and bowed; the hands were rubbed
together graciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lack, I know not; a supper for a king was ordered by a ragged
Roundhead,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Here are two petticoats, your ladyship.
When I know which petticoat is which petticoat, your ladyship, I will serve the
dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tavern-keeper sidled toward the kitchen-door. As he went out, he
muttered, judiciously low: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give a ha&#8217;penny for the
choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beggar!&#8221; snapped Portsmouth. &#8220;Musty place, musty
furniture, musty <i>garçon</i>, musty everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood aloof in the centre of the room as if fearful lest she might be
contaminated by her surroundings.</p>

<p>Nell approached her respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may like it better after supper, madame,&#8221; she suggested,
mildly. &#8220;A good spread, sparkling wine and most congenial company have
cast a halo o&#8217;er more time-begrimed rafters than these.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, madame?&#8221; inquired the Duchess, haughtily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;A
fellow-passenger on the earth,&#8221; gently replied Nell, &#8220;and a lover of
good company, and&#8211;some wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said the Duchess, in a way that only a woman can ask and
answer a question with a &#8220;yes&#8221; and with a look such as only a woman
can give another woman when she asks and answers that little question with a
&#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>

<p>The Duchess continued: &#8220;Perhaps you have seen the cavalier I
await.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, not I,&#8221; replied Nell, promptly; and she bethought her
that she had kept a pretty sharp lookout for him, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this a proper place for a lady to visit?&#8221; pompously inquired
the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You raise the first doubt,&#8221; said Nell quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame!&#8221; exclaimed Portsmouth, interrupting her, with fiery
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you are the first to question the propriety of the
place,&#8221; explained Nell, apologetically, though she delighted inwardly at
the intended shot which she had given her grace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>&#8220;I came by
appointment,&#8221; continued the Duchess; &#8220;but it seems I was misled.
<i>Garçon</i>, my chair!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess made a move toward the door, but Nell&#8217;s words stopped
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be patient, Duchess! He is too gallant to desert you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows me!&#8221; thought Portsmouth. She turned sharply upon the
stranger. &#8220;I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance,
madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such is my loss, not yours,&#8221; replied Nell, suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remove your veil,&#8221; commanded the Duchess; and her eyes flashed
through her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not before the beauty of Versailles,&#8221; continued Nell,
sweetly. &#8220;Remove yours first. Then I may take mine off unseen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know you?&#8221; suspiciously inquired Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not,&#8221; said Nell, meekly, and she courtesied low. &#8220;I
am but an humble player&#8211;called Nell Gwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess raised herself to her full height.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>&#8220;Nell
Gwyn!&#8221; she hissed, and she fairly tore off her veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grace&#8217;s most humble servant,&#8221; said Nell, again
courtesying low and gracefully removing her veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a trap,&#8221; exclaimed the Duchess, as she realized the
situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven bless the brain that set it then,&#8221; sweetly suggested
Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own, minx,&#8221; snapped Portsmouth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not look
at the hussy!&#8221; she muttered. She crossed the room and seated herself upon
the bench, back to Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grace would be more kind if you knew my joy at seeing
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221; asked the Duchess, ironically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would emulate your warmth and amiability,&#8221; tenderly responded
Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Portsmouth; but how much again there was in her
little &#8220;yes,&#8221; accented as it was with a French shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I adore a beautiful woman,&#8221; continued Nell, &#8220;especially
when I know her to be&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A successful rival?&#8221; triumphantly <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span> asked the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rival!&#8221; exclaimed Nell, in well-feigned astonishment, still
toying with the Duchess&#8217;s temper. &#8220;Is the poor actress so honoured
in a duchess&#8217;s thought? Your grace is generous.&#8221;</p>

<p>If all the angels had united, they could not have made her speech more sweet
or her manner more enticing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presumed you might conceive it so,&#8221; replied Portsmouth, with
mocking, condescending mien.</p>

<p>Nell approached her timidly and spoke softly, lovingly, subserviently.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rival to the great Duchess of Portsmouth!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Perish the thought! It is with trepidation I look upon your glorious
face, madame; a figure that would tempt St. Anthony; a foot so small it makes us
swear the gods have lent invisible wings to waft you to your conquest. Nay, do
not turn your rosy lip in scorn; I am in earnest, so in earnest, that, were I
but a man, I would bow me down your constant slave&#8211;unless perchance you
should grow fat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>The turn was
delicious: Nell&#8217;s face was a study; and so was Portsmouth&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The Duchess sprang to her feet, realizing fully for the first time that she
had been trapped and trifled with. &#8220;Hussy! Beware your own lacings,&#8221;
she angrily exclaimed, turning now full face upon her adversary.</p>

<p>Nell was leaning against the table across the room, quietly observing
Portsmouth upon the word-wrack. Her whole manner had changed. She watched with
evident delight the play of discomfiture, mingled with contempt, upon the
beautiful Duchess&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Me</i> fat!&#8221; she derisively laughed. &#8220;Be sure I shall
never grow too much so. And have not the stars said I shall ne&#8217;er grow
old?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your stars are falser than yourself,&#8221; tartly snapped the
Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayhap,&#8221; said Nell, still gleeful; &#8220;but mark you this
truth: I shall reign queen of Love and Laughter while I live, and die with the
first wrinkle.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was interrupted by his Majesty, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_156'></a>156</span> who, unsuspecting, swaggered into the room in
buoyant spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King!&#8221; exclaimed Nell, as she slyly glanced over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>The King looked at one woman and then at the other in dismay and horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scylla and Charybdis!&#8221; he muttered, nervously, glancing about
for means of escape. &#8220;All my patron-saints protect me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell was by his side in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good even&#8217; to your Majesty,&#8221; she roguishly exclaimed.
&#8220;How can I ever thank you, Sire, for inviting the Duchess to sup with me!
I have been eager to meet her ladyship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ods-pitikins,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;a loophole for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8211;you see&#8211;&#8221; he said, &#8220;a little surprise,
Nelly,&#8211;a little surprise&#8211;for me.&#8221; The last two words were not
audible to his hearers. He looked at the beautiful rivals an instant, then
ventured, &#8220;I hoped to be in time to introduce you, ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your Majesty,&#8221; asserted Nell, consolingly, &#8220;we are
already quite well <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
acquainted. I knew her grace through her veil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt on&#8217;t,&#8221; observed the King, knowingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sire,&#8221; said the Duchess, haughtily, casting a frigid glance
at Nell, &#8220;I warrant we understand each other perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better and better,&#8221; said Charles, with a sickly laugh.</p>

<p>His Majesty saw rocks and shoals ahead, and his wits could find no channel of
escape. He turned in dire distress upon Nell, who stood aloof. She looked up
into his face with the innocence of a babe in every feature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minx, this is your work!&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sire!&#8221; she answered, mock-reprovingly, bending quite to the
floor as she courtesied low.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, Sire.&#8217; Baggage!&#8221; he exclaimed good-naturedly despite
himself.</p>

<p>As he turned away, praying Heaven to see him out of the difficulty, he
observed the landlord, who had just entered <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_158'></a>158</span> with bread and cups, muttering some dubious
invocations to himself. He clutched at this piece of human stupidity&#8211;like
a drowning man clutching at a straw: &#8220;Ah, landlord, bring in what we live
for; and haste ye, sirrah. The wine! The wine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is ready, sir,&#8221; obsequiously replied the landlord, who had
just sense enough in his dull cranium to reflect also, by way of complement,
&#8220;So is Constable Swallow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news, good news!&#8221; cried Charles; and he tossed his plumed
hat upon the sideboard, preparatory to the feast. &#8220;D&#8217;ye hear, my
fair and loving friends? Come, it is impolite to keep the capons waiting. My
arms; my arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>The King stepped gallantly between the ladies, making a bold play for peace.
The Duchess took one arm formally. Nell seized the remaining arm and almost
hugged his Majesty, nestling her head affectionately against his shoulder.
Charles observed the decorum of due dignity. He was impartial to a fault; for he
realized that there only lay his salvation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>The phalanx
approached the feast in solemn march. The King tossed his head proudly and
observed: &#8220;Who would not play the thorn with two such buds to blush on
either side?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a halt. The Duchess looked coldly at the table, then coldly at the
King, then more coldly at Nell. The King looked at each inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought your Majesty ordered supper for three,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;It is set for two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish, for two!&#8221; cried Charles, glancing, anxiously, for the
first time at the collation.</p>

<p>Nell had taken her place at the feast, regardless of formality. She was
looking out for herself, irrespective of King or Duchess. She believed that a
dinner, like the grave, renders all equal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Egad!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she dwelt upon the force of the
Duchess&#8217;s observation. &#8220;Our host is teaching us the virtues of
economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The unsuspecting landlord re-entered at this moment, wine in hand, which he
proceeded to place upon the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;What do
you mean, knave, by this treachery!&#8221; almost shrieked the King at sight of
him. &#8220;Another plate, dost hear; another plate, dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me,&#8221; explained the landlord, in confusion, &#8220;you said
supper for two, sir; that a man was a fool who dined more; that the third was
expensive and in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Villain!&#8221; cried Charles, in a hopeless effort to suppress the
fellow, &#8220;I said two-two&#8211;beside myself. I never count myself in the
presence of these ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The Duchess smiled a chilling smile, and asked complacently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one of us did you expect, Sire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, which did you expect, Sire?&#8221; laughed Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my head,&#8221; groaned Charles; &#8220;well, well,&#8211;you
see&#8211;Duchess, the matter lies in this wise&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me help your Majesty,&#8221; generously interrupted Nell.
&#8220;Her ladyship is ill at figures. You see, Charles and I are <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span> one, and you make two,
Duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke to the King,&#8221; haughtily replied the Duchess, not
deigning to glance at Nell.</p>

<p>The King placed his hands upon his forehead in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a question for the Prime Minister and sages of the realm in
council.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but two chairs, Sire,&#8221; continued Portsmouth,
coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two chairs!&#8221; exclaimed the Merry Monarch, aghast, as he saw the
breach hopelessly widening. &#8220;I am lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is serious, Sire,&#8221; said Nell, sadly; and then her eye
twinkled as she suggested, &#8220;but perhaps we might make out with one, for
the Duchess&#8217;s sake. I am so little.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her head and laughed gaily, while she watched the Duchess&#8217;s
face out of the corner of her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sheart,&#8221; sighed the King, &#8220;I have construed grave
controversies of state in my time, but ne&#8217;er drew the line yet betwixt black
eyes and blue, brunette and blonde, when both were present. Another <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span> chair, landlord! Come,
my sweethearts; eat, drink and forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King threw himself carelessly into a chair in the hope that, in meat and
drink, he might find peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; acquiesced Nell, who was already at work, irrespective of
ceremony, &#8220;eat, drink and forget! I prefer to quarrel after
supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not,&#8221; said the Duchess, who still stood indignant in the
centre of the room.</p>

<p>Nell could scarce speak, for her mouthful; but she replied gaily, with a
French shrug, in imitation of the Duchess:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well! I have a solution. Let&#8217;s play sphinx,
Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles looked up hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything for peace,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;How
is&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; explained Nell, with the philosophical air of a learned
doctor, &#8220;some years before you and I thought much about the ways and means
of this wicked world, your Majesty, the Sphinx spent her leisure asking people
riddles; and if they could not answer, she ate them alive. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span> Give me some of that turbot.
Don&#8217;t stand on ceremony, Sire; for the Duchess is waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King hastened to refill Nell&#8217;s plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; laughed the vixen; &#8220;that will do for now. Let
the Duchess propound a riddle from the depths of her subtle brain; and if I do
not fathom it upon the instant, Sire, &#8217;t is the Duchess&#8217;s&#8211;not
Nell&#8217;s&#8211;evening with the King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish, a great stake!&#8221; cried Charles. He arose with a
serio-comic air, much pleased at the turn things were taking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too confident, madame,&#8221; ironically suggested the
Duchess; &#8220;you are cleverer in making riddles than in solving
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke, the room was suddenly filled with savoury odour. The moon-faced
landlord had again appeared, flourishing a platter containing two finely roasted
chickens. His face glowed with pride and ale.</p>

<p>&#8220;The court&#8217;s famished,&#8221; exclaimed Charles, as he greeted
the inn-keeper; &#8220;proceed!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>&#8220;Two
capons! I have it,&#8221; triumphantly thought Portsmouth, as she reflected upon
a riddle she had once heard in far-off France. It could not be known in England.
Nothing so clever could be known in England. She looked contemptuously at Nell,
and then at the two chickens, as she propounded it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let your wits find then three capons on this plate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three chickens!&#8221; cried Charles, in wonderment, closely
scrutinizing the two fowl upon the plate and then looking up inquiringly at the
Duchess. &#8220;There are but two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell only gurgled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another glass, landlord, and I&#8217;ll see four,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s to you two, and to me too.&#8221; She drank gaily to her
toast.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the answer, madame,&#8221; coldly retorted the
Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we come to blows over two innocent chickens?&#8221; asked Charles,
somewhat concerned still for the outcome. &#8220;Bring on your witnesses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span> &#8220;This is one
chicken, your Majesty,&#8221; declared the Duchess. &#8220;Another&#8217;s two;
and two and one make three.&#8221;</p>

<p>With much formality and something of the air of a conjurer, she counted the
first chicken and the second chicken and then recounted the first chicken, in
such a way as to make it appear that there were three birds in all.</p>

<p>The King, who was ill at figures, like all true spendthrifts, sat confused by
her speech. Nell laughed again. The landlord, who was in and out, stopped long
enough to enter upon his bill, in rambling characters, &#8220;3 chickens.&#8221;
This was all his dull ear had comprehended. He then piously proceeded on his
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gadso!&#8221; exclaimed the King, woefully. &#8220;It is too much for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, pooh, &#8217;tis too simple for you, Sire,&#8221; laughed Nell.
&#8220;I solved it when a child. Here is my bird; and here is your bird; and our
dearest Duchess shall sup on her third bird!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell quickly spitted one chicken upon a huge fork and so removed it to her
own <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span> plate. The
second chicken, she likewise conveyed to his Majesty&#8217;s. Then, with all the
politeness which she only could summon, she bowed low and offered the empty
platter to the Duchess.</p>

<p>Portsmouth struck it to the board angrily with her gloved hand and steadied
herself against the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hussy!&#8221; she hissed, and forthwith pretended to grow faint.</p>

<p>Charles was at her elbow in an instant, supporting her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8211;Sire, I&#8211;&#8221; she continued, in her efforts to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried Charles, seriously, endeavouring to assist
her. &#8220;You are pale, Louise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am faint,&#8221; replied she, with much difficulty. &#8220;Pardon my
longer audience, Sire; I am not well. <i>Garçon</i>, my chair. Assist me to the
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat landlord made a hasty exit, for him, toward the street, in his desire
to help the great lady. Charles supported her to the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call a leech, Sire,&#8221; cried Nell after <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span> them, with mock sympathy. &#8220;Her
grace has choked on a chicken-bone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still, wench,&#8221; commanded the King. &#8220;Do not leave us,
Louise; it breaks the sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; pleaded Nell also, &#8220;do not go because of this little
merry-making, Duchess. I desire we may become better friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice revived the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sans doute</i>, we shall, madame,&#8221; Portsmouth replied,
coldly. &#8220;<i>À mon bal! Pas adieu, mais au revoir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great Duchess courtesied low, kissed the King&#8217;s hand, arose to her
full height and, with an eye-shot at Nell, took her departure.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>Arrest him yourself!</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The King stood at the door, thoughtfully reflecting on the temper of the
departing Duchess. She was a maid of honour and, more than that, an emissary
from his brother Louis of France. Gossip said he loved her, but it was not true,
though he liked her company exceeding well when the mood suited. He regretted
only the evening&#8217;s incident, with the harsher feeling it was sure to
engender.</p>

<p>Nell stood by the fireplace, muttering French phrases in humorous imitation
of her grace. Observing the King&#8217;s preoccupation, she tossed a
<i>serviette</i> merrily at his head.</p>

<p>This brought his Majesty to himself again. He turned, and laughed as he saw
her; for his brain and heart delighted in her merry-making. He loved her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What means this vile French?&#8221; she <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span> asked, with delicious suggestion of the
shrug, accent and manner of her vanquished rival.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess means,&#8221; explained the King, &#8220;that she gives a
royal ball&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And invites me?&#8221; broke in Nell, quickly, placing her elbows upon
a cask and looking over it impishly at Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;And invites you <i>not</i>&#8221; said the King, &#8220;and so outwits
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By her porters&#8217; wits and not her own,&#8221; retorted Nell.</p>

<p>She threw herself into a chair and became oblivious for the moment of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The French hussy! So she gives a ball?&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;Well, well, I&#8217;ll be there! I&#8217;ll teach her much. Oh,
I&#8217;ll be pretty, too, aye, very pretty. No fear yet of rivalry or harm for
England.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles watched her amusedly, earnestly, lovingly. The vixen had fallen
unconsciously into imitating again the Duchess&#8217;s foreign ways, as an
accompaniment even for her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sans doute</i>, we shall, <i>madame</i>&#8221; Nell <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span> muttered audibly, with
much gesticulating and a mocking accent. &#8220;<i>À mon bal! Pas adieu, mais au
revoir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King came closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;that you do mutter so and wildly
act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only thinking that, if I were a man,&#8221; she said, turning
toward him playfully, &#8220;I would love your Duchess to devotion. Her wit is
so original, her repartee so sturdy. Your Majesty&#8217;s taste in
horses&#8211;and some women&#8211;is excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed the room gaily and threw herself laughing upon the bench. The
King followed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven help the being, naughty Nell,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who
offends thy merry tongue; but I love thee for it.&#8221; He sat down beside her
in earnest adoration, then caught her lovingly in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love me?&#8221; sighed Nell, scarce mindful of the embrace. &#8220;Ah,
Sire, I am but a plaything for the King at best, a caprice, a fancy&#8211;naught
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, sweet,&#8221; said Charles, &#8220;you have not read this
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;I have
read it too deeply,&#8221; replied Nell, with much meaning in her voice.
&#8220;It is this one to-day, that one to-morrow, with King Charles. Ah, Sire,
your love for the poor player-girl is summed up in three little words: &#8216;I amuse
you!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amuse me!&#8221; exclaimed Charles, thoughtfully. &#8220;Hark ye,
Nell! States may marry us; they cannot make us love. Ye Gods, the humblest
peasant in my realm is monarch of a heart of his own choice. Would I were such a
king!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What buxom country lass,&#8221; asked Nell, sadly but wistfully,
&#8220;teaches your fancy to follow the plough, my truant master?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget: I too,&#8221; continued Charles, &#8220;have been an
outcast, like Orange Nell, seeking a crust and bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose and turned away sadly to suppress his emotion. He was not the King
of England now: he was a man who had suffered; he was a man among men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Sire,&#8221; said Nell, tenderly, as a woman only can
speak, &#8220;if I recall unhappy times.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_172'></a>172</span>&#8220;Unhappy!&#8221; echoed Charles, while Fancy
toyed with Recollection. &#8220;Nell, in those dark days, I learned to read the
human heart. God taught me then the distinction &#8217;twixt friend and enemy. When a
misled rabble had dethroned my father, girl, and murdered him before our palace
gate, and bequeathed the glorious arts and progressive sciences to religious
bigots and fanatics, to trample under foot and burn&#8211;when, if a little bird
sang overjoyously, they cut out his tongue for daring to be merry&#8211;in some
lonely home by some stranger&#8217;s hearth, a banished prince, called Charles
Stuart, oft found an asylum of plenty and repose; and in your eyes, my Nell, I
read the self-same, loyal, English heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was all the sadness of great music in his speech. Nell fell upon her
knee, and kissed his hand, reverently.</p>

<p>&#8220;My King!&#8221; she said; and her voice trembled with passionate
love.</p>

<p>He raised her tenderly and kissed her upon the lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;My queen,&#8221; he said; and his voice <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span> too trembled with passionate love.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Milton says that Paradise is lost,&#8221; whispered Nell. Her head
rested on the King&#8217;s shoulder. She looked up&#8211;the picture of perfect
happiness&#8211;into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while Nell loves Charles,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Charles remembers Nell,&#8221; her voice answered, softly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rotund landlord had entered unobserved; and a contrast he
made, indeed, to the endearing words of the lovers as at this instant he
unceremoniously burst forth in guttural accents with:</p>

<p>&#8220;The bill! The bill for supper, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell looked at the King and the King looked at Nell; then both looked at the
landlord. The lovers&#8217; sense of humour was boundless. That was their first
tie; the second, their hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bill!&#8221; repeated Nell, smothering a laugh. &#8220;Yes, we
were just speaking of the bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How opportune!&#8221; exclaimed Charles, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span> taking the cue. &#8220;We feared you
would forget it, sirrah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See that it is right,&#8221; ejaculated Nell.</p>

<p>The King glanced at the bill indifferently, but still could not fail to see
&#8220;3 chickens&#8221; in unschooled hand. His eyes twinkled and he glanced at
the landlord, but the latter avoided his look with a pretence of innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad,&#8221; said Charles, with a swagger, &#8220;what are a few extra
shillings to Parliament? Here, my man.&#8221; He placed a hand in a pocket, but
found it empty. &#8220;No; it is in the other pocket.&#8221; He placed his hand
in another, only to find it also empty. Then he went through the remaining
pockets, one by one, turning them each out for inspection&#8211;his face
assuming an air of mirthful hopelessness as he proceeded. He had changed his
garb for a merry lark, but had neglected to change his purse. &#8220;Devil
on&#8217;t, I&#8211;have&#8211;forgotten&#8211;Odsfish, where is my
treasurer?&#8221; he exclaimed at last.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i8'></a><img src='images/nell-174.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
THE DECEPTION.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>&#8220;Your
treasurer!&#8221; shrieked the landlord, who had watched Charles&#8217;s search,
with twitching eyes. &#8220;Want your treasurer, do ye? Constable
Swallow&#8217;ll find him for ye. Constable Swallow! I knew you were a rascal,
by your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles laughed.</p>

<p>This exasperated the landlord still further. He began to flutter about the
room aimlessly, bill in hand. He presented it to Charles and he presented it to
Nell, who would have none of it; while at intervals he called loudly for the
constable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, my man,&#8221; entreated Nell; &#8220;be still for
mercy&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good lack, my lady,&#8221; pleaded the landlord, in despair,
&#8220;good lack, but you would not see a poor man robbed by a vagabond, would
ye? Constable Swallow!&#8221;</p>

<p>The situation was growing serious indeed. The King was mirthful still, but
Nell was fearful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, have you no money to stop this heathen&#8217;s mouth?&#8221; he
finally ejaculated, as he caught up his bonnet and tossed it jauntily upon his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a farthing,&#8221; replied she, sharply. &#8220;I was invited to
sup, not pay the bill.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>&#8220;If the
King knew this rascal,&#8221; yelled the landlord at the top of his voice,
pointing to Charles, &#8220;he would be behind the bars long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too much for his Majesty, who broke into the merriest of laughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Verily, I believe you,&#8221; he admitted. Then he fell to laughing
again, almost rolling off the bench in his glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Constable,&#8221; wildly repeated the landlord, at the
kitchen-door. &#8220;Let my new wife alone; they are making off with the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell was filled with consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll raise the neighbourhood, Sire,&#8221; she whispered to
Charles. &#8220;Have you no money to stop this heathen&#8217;s mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even holes in my pockets,&#8221; calmly replied the Merry
Monarch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish, what company am I got into!&#8221; sighed Nell. She ran to
the landlord and seized his arm in her endeavour to quiet him.</p>

<p>The landlord, however, was beside himself. He stood at the kitchen-door
gesticulating ferociously and still shouting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_177'></a>177</span> at the top of his voice: &#8220;Constable Swallow!
Help, help; thieves; Constable Swallow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Swallow staggered into the room with all his dignity aboard. Tankard in hand,
he made a dive for the table, and catching it firmly, surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>Nell turned to her lover for protection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder, hic!&#8221; ejaculated the constable. &#8220;Thieves!
What&#8217;s the row?&#8211;Hic!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest this blackguard,&#8221; commanded the landlord, nervously,
&#8220;this perfiler of honest men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest!&#8211;You drunken idiot!&#8221; indignantly exclaimed Charles;
and his sword cut the air before the constable&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Nell seized his arm. Her woman&#8217;s intuition showed her the better
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will raise a nest of them,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;You need
your wits, Sire; not your sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; come on, I say,&#8221; cried Charles, fearlessly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll see what his Majesty&#8217;s constables are made
of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You rogue&#8211;<i>Posse!</i>&#8221; exclaimed Swallow, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span> starting boldly for the
King, then making a brilliant retreat, calling loudly for help, as the rapier
tickled him in the ribs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ruffian&#8211;<i>Posse!</i>&#8221; he continued to call,
alternately, first to one and then to the other; for his fear paralyzed all but
his tongue. &#8220;You outlaw&#8211;<i>Posse
commi-ti-titous</i>&#8211;hic!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buzzard also now entered from his warm nest in the kitchen, so intoxicated
that he vented his enthusiasm in song, which in this case seemed apt:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;The man that is drunk is as great as a king.&#8221;</i></p>
</div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;Another champion of the King&#8217;s law!&#8221; ejaculated Charles,
not without a shadow of contempt in his voice, once more assuming an attitude of
defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Charles!&#8221; pleaded Nell, again catching his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Posse</i>, arrest that vagabond,&#8221; commanded the constable,
from a point of safety behind the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; replied the obedient Buzzard. &#8220;On what
charge&#8211;hic?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_179'></a>179</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s a law-breaker and a robber!&#8221;
yelled the watchful landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;He called the law a drunken idiot. Hic&#8211;hic!&#8221; woefully
wailed Swallow. &#8220;Odsbud, that&#8217;s treason! Arrest him,
<i>posse</i>&#8211;hic!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knave, I arrest&#8211;hic!&#8221; asserted Buzzard.</p>

<p>The <i>posse</i> started boldly enough for his game, but was suddenly brought
to a stand-still in his reeling course by the sharp point of the rapier playing
about his legs. He made several indignant efforts to overcome the obstacle. The
point of the blade was none too gentle with him, even as he beat a retreat; and
his enthusiasm waned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest him yourself&#8211;hic!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Swallow&#8217;s face grew red with rage. To have his orders disobeyed fired
him with much more indignation of soul than the escape of the ruffian, who was
simply defrauding the landlord of a dinner. He turned hotly upon the
insubordinate <i>posse</i>, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll arrest you, you Buzzard&#8211;hic!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_180'></a>180</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll arrest you, you
Swallow&#8211;hic!&#8221; with equal dignity retorted Buzzard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m his Majesty&#8217;s constable&#8211;hic!&#8221; hissed
Swallow, from lips charged with air, bellows-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m his Majesty&#8217;s <i>posse</i>&#8211;hic!&#8221; hissed
Buzzard in reply.</p>

<p>The two drunken representatives of the law seized each other angrily. The
landlord, in despair, endeavoured hopelessly to separate them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wrangle of the generals,&#8221; laughed Charles. &#8220;Now is our
time.&#8221; He looked about quickly for an exit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Body o&#8217; me! The vagabonds&#8217;ll escape,&#8221; shouted the
landlord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fly, fly!&#8221; said Nell. &#8220;This way, Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran hastily toward the steps leading to the entry-way; the King assisted
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, thief! Stop, thief!&#8221; screamed the landlord. &#8220;The
bill! The bill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send it to the Duchess!&#8221; replied Nell, gaily, as she and the
Merry Monarch darted into the night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>The landlord
turned in despair, to find the drunken champions of the King&#8217;s law in a
struggling heap upon the floor. He raised his foot and took out vengeance where
vengeance could be found.</p>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>In the field, men; at court, women!</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>It was the evening of Portsmouth&#8217;s long-awaited <i>bal masqué</i>.
Music filled her palace with rhythmic sound. In the gardens, its mellowing
strains died away among the shrubs and over-hanging boughs. In every nook and
corner wandered at will the nobility&#8211;the richest&#8211;the
greatest&#8211;in the land.</p>

<p>None entertain like the French; and the Duchess had, indeed, exhausted French
art in turning the grand old place into a land of ravishing enchantment, with
its many lights, its flowers, its works of art. Her abode was truly an
enlivening scene, with its variety of maskers, bright dominoes and vizards.</p>

<p>The King was there and took a merry part in all the sport, although, beneath
his swaggering abandon, there lurked a vein of sadness. He laughed heartily, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span> danced gaily, he
jested with one and all; but his manner was assumed. The shrewdest woman&#8217;s
eye could not have seen it; though she might have felt it. Brother James too
enjoyed the dance, despite his piety; and Buckingham, Rochester and a score of
courtiers beloved by the King entered mirthfully into the scene, applauding the
Duchess&#8217;s entertainment heartily.</p>

<p>As the evening wore apace, the merry maskers grew merrier and merrier. In a
drawing-room adjoining the great ball-room, a robber-band, none other than
several gallants, whose identity was concealed by silken vizards, created huge
amusement by endeavouring to steal a kiss from Lady Hamilton. She feigned
shyness, then haughtiness, then anger; then she ran. They were after her and
about her in an instant. There were cries of &#8220;A kiss!&#8221; &#8220;A
kiss!&#8221; &#8220;This way!&#8221; &#8220;Make a circle or she&#8217;ll escape
us!&#8221;</p>

<p>A dozen kisses so were stolen by the eager gallants before my lady broke
away, stamping her foot in indignation, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8220;Nay, I am
very angry, very&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That there were no more, wench!&#8221; laughed Buckingham.
&#8220;Marry, &#8217;tis a merry night when Portsmouth reigns. Long live the
Duchess in the King&#8217;s heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you may capture its fairer favourite, friend Buckingham?&#8221;
suggested the King, softly; and there was no hidden meaning in his speech, for
the King suspected that Buckingham&#8217;s heart as well was not at
Portsmouth&#8217;s and Buckingham knew that the King suspected it.</p>

<p>Buckingham was the prince of courtiers; he bowed low and, saying much without
saying anything, replied respectfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;So I may console her, Sire, that she is out-beautied by France
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out-beautied! Not bidden, thou mean&#8217;st,&#8221; exclaimed the King, his
thoughts roving toward Nelly&#8217;s terrace. Ah, how he longed to be there!
&#8220;The room is close,&#8221; he fretted. &#8220;Come, gallants, to the
promenade!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was dressed in white and gold; and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_185'></a>185</span> a princely prince he looked, indeed, as the
courtiers separated for him to pass out between them.</p>

<p>All followed save Buckingham, whom Portsmouth&#8217;s eye detained.</p>

<p>She broke into a joyous laugh as she turned from the tapestry-curtains,
through which she could see his Majesty&#8211;the centre of a mirthful scene
without.</p>

<p>&#8220;What say you now, my lord?&#8221; she asked, triumphantly, of
Buckingham. &#8220;I am half avenged already, and the articles half signed. The
King is here despite his Madame Gwyn, and in a playful mood that may be tuned to
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s ardour did not kindle as she hoped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merriment is oft but Sadness&#8217;s mask, Louise,&#8221; he replied,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What meanest thou?&#8221; she asked, in her nervous, Gallic way, and
as quickly, her mind anticipating, answered: &#8220;This trifle of the gossips
that Charles advances the player&#8217;s whim to found a hospital at Chelsea,
for broken-down old soldiers? <i>Ce n&#8217;est rien!&#8221;</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>She broke into a
mocking laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye!&#8221; replied Buckingham, quietly but significantly. &#8220;The
orders are issued for its building and the people are cheering Nell throughout
the realm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ma foi!</i>&#8221; came from the Duchess&#8217;s contemptuous lips.
&#8220;And what say the rabble of Portsmouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That she is Louis&#8217;s pensioner sent here from France&#8211;a
spy!&#8221; he answered, quickly and forcefully too. &#8220;The hawkers cry it
in the streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fools! Fools!&#8221; she mused. Then, making sure that no arras had
ears, she continued: &#8220;Before the night is done, thou shalt hear that
Luxembourg has fallen to the French&#8211;Mark!&#8211;Luxembourg! Feed the
rabble on that, my lord. Heaven preserve King Louis!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke started incredulously. When had Portsmouth seen the King? and by
what arts had she won the royal consent? A score of questions trembled on his
lips&#8211;and yet were checked before the utterance. Not an intimation before
of her success had reached his ear, though he had <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span> advised with the Duchess almost daily
since their accidental meeting below Nell&#8217;s terrace. Indeed, in his heart,
he had never believed that she would be able so to dupe the King. The shadow
from the axe which fell upon Charles I. still cast its warning gloom athwart the
walls of Whitehall; and, in the face of the temper of the English people and of
well-known treaties, the acquiescence of Charles II. in Louis&#8217;s project
would be but madness. Luxembourg was the key strategetically to the Netherlands
and the states beyond. Its fall meant the augmentation of the Empire of Louis,
the personal ignominy of Charles!</p>

<p>&#8220;Luxembourg!&#8221; He repeated the word cautiously. &#8220;King
Charles did not consent&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; replied the Duchess, in her sweetest way, &#8220;but I
knew he would; and so I sent the message in advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgery! &#8217;Twas boldly done, Louise,&#8221; cried Buckingham, in tones
of admiration mixed with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew my power, my lord,&#8221; she said <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span> confidently; and her eyes glistened
with womanly pride as she added: &#8220;The consent will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s eyes&#8211;usually so frank&#8211;fell; and, for some
seconds, he stood seemingly lost in abstraction over the revelations made by the
Duchess. He was, however, playing a deeper game than he appeared to play.
Apparently in thoughtlessness, he began to toy with a ring which hung upon a
ribbon about his neck and which till then had been cautiously concealed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, what have you there?&#8221; questioned Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Buckingham&#8217;s face assumed an expression of surprise. He pretended not
to comprehend the import of her words.</p>

<p>She pointed to the ring.</p>

<p>He glanced at it as though he regretted it had been seen, then added
carelessly, apparently to appease but really to whet the Duchess&#8217;s
curiosity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely a ring the King gave Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was more than curiosity now in Portsmouth&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>&#8220;I
borrowed it to show it you,&#8221; continued Buckingham, indifferently, then
asked, with tantalizing calmness: &#8220;Is your mission quite
complete?&#8221;</p>

<p>With difficulty, the Duchess mastered herself. Without replying, she walked
slowly toward the table, in troubled thought. The mask of crime revealed itself
in her beautiful features, as she said, half to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a potion I brought from France.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was of the Latin race and poison was a heritage.</p>

<p>Buckingham caught the words not meant for him, and realized too well their
sinister meaning. Poison Nell! His eyes swept the room fearfully and he
shuddered. He hastened to Portsmouth&#8217;s side, and in cold whispers
importuned her:</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s mercy, woman, as you love yourself and
me&#8211;poison is an unhealthy diet to administer in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess turned upon him impatiently. The black lines faded slowly from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> her face; but they
still were there, beneath the beauty-lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;My servants have watched her house without avail,&#8221; she sneered.
&#8220;Your plan is useless; my plan will work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay!&#8221; pleaded Buckingham, still fearful. &#8220;We can
ourselves entice some adventurous spirit up Nell&#8217;s terrace, then trap him.
So our end is reached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; replied the Duchess, in milder mood, realizing that she
had been over-hasty at least in speech, &#8220;the minx presumes to love the
King, and so is honest! But of her later. The treaties! He shall sign
to-night&#8211;to-night, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a triumphant air, she pointed to the quills and sand upon a table in
readiness for his signing.</p>

<p>Buckingham smiled approvingly; and in his smile lurked flattery so adroit
that it pleased the Duchess despite herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Hyde, St. Albans and the rest,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are here to
aid the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; answered Portsmouth, with a shrug. &#8220;In the field,
men; at court, women! This girl has outwitted you all. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span> I must accomplish my mission alone.
Charles must be Louis&#8217;s pensioner in full; England the slave of France! My
fortune&#8211;<i>Le Grand Roi&#8217;s</i> regard&#8211;hang upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham cautioned her with a startled gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; smiled Portsmouth, complacently, &#8220;I may speak
frankly, my lord; for your head is on the same block still with mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my heart, Louise,&#8221; he said, in admiration. &#8220;Back to
the King! Do nothing rash. We will banish thy rival, dear hostess.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not add, save in thought, that Nell&#8217;s banishment, if left to
him, would be to his own country estate.</p>

<p>There was almost a touch of affection in the Duchess&#8217;s voice as she
prepared to join the King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave all to me, my lord,&#8221; she said, then courtesied low.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, all but Nell!&#8221; reflected his lordship, as he watched her
depart. &#8220;With this ring, I&#8217;ll keep thee wedded to jealous <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span> interest, and so enrich
my purse and power. Thou art a great woman, fair France; I half love thee
myself. But thou knowest only a moiety of my purpose. The other half is
Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood absorbed in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>The draperies at the further doorway, on which was worked in Gobelin
tapestry a forest with its grand, imposing oaks, were pushed nervously aside.
Jack Hart entered, mask in hand, and scanned the room with skeptic eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;A happy meeting,&#8221; mused Buckingham, reflecting upon Hart&#8217;s
one-time ardour for Mistress Nell and upon the possibility that that ardour, if
directed by himself, might yet compromise Nell in the King&#8217;s eyes and lead
to the realization of his own fond dreams of greater wealth and power and, still
more sweet, to the possession of his choice among all the beauties of the
realm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sad hour,&#8221; thought Hart, glancing at the merry dancers
through the arch, &#8220;when all the world, like players, wear
masks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>Buckingham
assumed an air of bonhomie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whither away, Master Hart?&#8221; he called after the player, who
started perceptibly at his voice. &#8220;Let not thy fancy play truant to this
gay assemblage, to mope in St. James&#8217;s Park.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord!&#8221; exclaimed Hart, hotly. The fire, however, was gone in
an instant; and he added, evidently under strong constraint: &#8220;Pardon; but
we prefer to change the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The drift&#8217;s the same,&#8221; chuckled the shrewd Buckingham;
&#8220;we may turn it to advantage.&#8221; He approached the player in a
friendly manner. &#8220;Be not angry,&#8221; he exclaimed soothingly; &#8220;for
there&#8217;s a rift even in the clouds of love. Brighter, man; for King Charles
was seeking your wits but now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have me play court-fool for him?&#8221; asked the
melancholy mime, who had in his nature somewhat of the cynicism of Jaques,
without his grand imaginings of soul. &#8220;There are many off the stage, my
lord, in better practice.&#8221; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_194'></a>194</span> &#8220;True, most true,&#8221; acquiesced
Buckingham; &#8220;I could point them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have continued in this vein but beyond the door, whence Hart had
just appeared, leading by a stair-way of cupids to the entrance to the palace,
arose the sound of many voices in noisy altercation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark ye, hark!&#8221; he exclaimed, in an alarmed tone. &#8220;What
is&#8217;t? Confusion in the great hallway below. We&#8217;ll see
to&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had assumed a certain supervision of the palace for the night. With the
player as a body-guard, he accordingly made a hasty exit.</p>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>Beau Adair is my name.</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The room was not long vacant. The hostess herself returned. She was
radiant.</p>

<p>As she crossed the threshold, she glanced back proudly at the revellers, who,
led by his Majesty, were turning night into day with their merry-making. She had
the right, indeed, to be proud; for the evening, though scarce half spent,
bespoke a complete triumph for her entertainment. This was the more gratifying
too, in that she knew that there were many at court who did not wish the
&#8220;imported&#8221; Duchess, as they called her, or her function well, though
they always smiled sweetly at each meeting and at each parting and deigned now
to feast beyond the limit of gentility upon her rich wines and collations.</p>

<p>The <i>bal masqué</i>, however, as we have seen, was with the Duchess but a
means <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span> to an end.
She took from the hand of a pretty page the treaties, lately re-drawn by
Bouillon, and glanced hastily over the parchments to see that her instructions
from Louis were covered by their words. A smile played on her arching lips as
she read and re-read and realized how near she was to victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis Portsmouth&#8217;s night to-night!&#8221; she mused. &#8220;My
great mission to England is nearly ended. Dear France, I feel that I was born
for thy advancement.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seated herself by the table, where the materials for writing had been
placed, and further dwelt upon the outcome of the royal agreements, their
contingencies and triumphs. She could write Charles Rex almost as well as the
King, she thought, as her eye caught the places left for his signature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bouillon never fails me,&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;Drawn by King
Charles&#8217;s consent, except perchance some trifling articles which I have
had interlined for Louis&#8217;s sake. We need not speak of them. It would be
troublesome to Charles. A <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_197'></a>197</span> little name and seal will make these papers
history.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her reflections were interrupted by the return of Buckingham, who was
laughing so that he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is &#8217;t?&#8221; she asked, petulantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guard have stayed but now a gallant, Irish youth,&#8221; replied
he, as best he could for laughter, &#8220;who swore that he had letters to your
highness. Oh, he swore, indeed; then pleaded; then threatened that he would
fight them all with single hand. Of course, he won the ladies&#8217; hearts, as
they entered the great hall, by his boyish swagger; but not the guards. Your
orders were imperative&#8211;that none unbidden to the ball could
enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well,&#8221; cried Portsmouth. &#8220;None, none! Letters to me!
Did he say from whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said,&#8221; continued Buckingham, still laughing, &#8220;that he
was under orders of his master to place them only in the Duchess&#8217;s hands.
Oh, he is a very lordly youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke throughout made a sad <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_198'></a>198</span> attempt at amusing imitations of the brogue of the
strange, youthful, Irish visitor who, with so much importunity, sought a
hearing.</p>

<p>Portsmouth reflected a moment and then said: &#8220;I will see him,
Buckingham, but briefly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham, not a little surprised, bowed and departed graciously to convey
the bidding.</p>

<p>The Duchess lost herself again in thought. &#8220;His message may have
import,&#8221; she reflected. &#8220;Louis sends strange messengers
ofttimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of her reverie, the tapestry at the door was again pushed back,
cautiously this time, then eagerly. There entered the prettiest spark that ever
graced a kingdom or trod a measure.</p>

<p>It was Nell, accoutred as a youth; and a bold play truly she was making. Her
face revealed that she herself was none too sure of the outcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;By my troth,&#8221; she thought, as she glanced uncomfortably about
the great room, &#8220;I feel as though I were all <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span> breeches.&#8221; She shivered.
&#8220;It is such a little way through these braveries to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes turned involuntarily to the corner where Portsmouth sat, now
dreaming of far-off France.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess!&#8221; her lips breathed, almost aloud, in her
excitement. &#8220;So you&#8217;d play hostess to his Majesty,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;give a royal ball and leave poor Nelly home, would
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess was conscious only of a presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Garçon!</i>&#8221; she called, without looking up.</p>

<p>Nell jumped a foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That shook me to the boots,&#8221; she ejaculated, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Garçon!</i>&#8221; again called the impatient Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; answered Nell, fearfully, the words seeming to stick in
her fair throat, as she hastily removed her hat and bethought her that she must
have a care or she would lose her head as well, by forgetting that she was an
Irishman with a brogue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>&#8220;Who are
you?&#8221; asked Portsmouth, haughtily, as, rising, with surprised eyes, she
became aware of the presence of a stranger.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is not strange that she was surprised. The youth who stood before
her was dressed from top to toe in gray&#8211;the silver-gray which lends a
colour to the cheek and piquancy to the form. The dress was of the latest cut.
The hat had the longest plume. The cloak hung gracefully save where the
glistening sword broke its falling lines. The boots were neat, well rounded and
well cut, encasing a jaunty leg. The dress was edged with silver.</p>

<p>Ah, the strange youth was a love, indeed, with his bright, sparkling eyes,
his lips radiant with smiles, his curls falling to his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; stammered Nell, in awkward hesitation but in the richest
brogue, as the Duchess repeated her inquiry, &#8220;I&#8217;m just I,
madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess smiled despite herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s very
clear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>&#8220;Yes,
that&#8217;s very clear,&#8221; reiterated Nell, still fearful of her
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;A modest masker, possibly,&#8221; suggested Portsmouth, observing the
youth&#8217;s embarrassment and wishing to assist him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, very modest,&#8221; replied Nell, her speech still stumbling,
&#8220;almost ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth&#8217;s eyes looked sharply at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She suspects me,&#8221; thought Nell, and her heart leaped into her
throat. &#8220;I am lost&#8211;boots and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name?&#8221; demanded the Duchess again, impatiently.</p>

<p>For the life of her Nell could not think of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she replied evasively, &#8220;I&#8217;m in London for
the first time in my present self, madame, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name and mission, sir?&#8221; The tone was imperative.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s wits returned to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beau Adair is my name,&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;and your service
my mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was out, though it had like to have choked her, and Nell was more herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span> again. The worst
she had feared was that the Duchess might discover her identity and so turn the
tables and make her the laughing-stock at court. She grew, indeed, quite hopeful
as she observed a kindly smile play upon the Duchess&#8217;s lips and caught the
observation: &#8220;Beau Adair! A pretty name, and quite a pretty
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile of self-satisfaction and a low bow were Nell&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vain coxcomb!&#8221; cried Portsmouth, reprovingly, though she was
highly amused and even pleased with the strange youth&#8217;s conceit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; if I admire not myself,&#8221; wistfully suggested Nell, in
reply, with pretence of much modesty, &#8220;who will praise poor me in this
great palace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are new at court?&#8221; asked Portsmouth, doubtingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite new,&#8221; asserted Nell, gaining confidence with each speech.
&#8220;My London tailor made a man of me only to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of you only to-day!&#8221; cried the Duchess, in wonderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He assured me, madame,&#8221; Nell hastened <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span> to explain, &#8220;that the fashion
makes the man. He did not like my former fashion. It hid too much that was good,
he said. I am the bearer of this letter to the great Duchess of Portsmouth; that
you are she, I know by your royalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bowed with a jaunty, boyish bow, sweeping the floor with her plumed hat,
as she offered the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are the gentleman,&#8221; said Portsmouth, recalling her
request to Buckingham, which for the instant had quite escaped her. She took the
letter and broke the seal eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She does not suspect,&#8221; thought Nell; and she crossed quickly to
the curtained arch, leading to the music and the dancing, in the hope that she
might see the King.</p>

<p>Portsmouth, who was absorbed in the letter, did not observe her.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Rochet! Dear Rochet!&#8221; mused the Duchess, as she read aloud
the lines: &#8220;&#8216;The bearer of this letter is a young gallant, very modest and
very little versed in the sins of court.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>&#8220;Very
little,&#8221; muttered Nell, with a mischievous wink, still intent upon the
whereabouts and doings of the King.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is of excellent birth,&#8217;&#8221; continued the Duchess,
reading, &#8220;&#8216;brave, young and to be trusted&#8211;<i>to be trusted</i>. I
commend him to your kindness, protection and service, during his stay in
town.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She reflected a moment intently upon the letter, then looked up quickly. Nell
returned, somewhat confused, to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very strong letter, sir,&#8221; said Portsmouth, with an
inquiring look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very strong,&#8221; promptly acquiesced Nell; and she chuckled as
she recalled that she had written it herself, taking near a fortnight in the
composition. Her fingers ached at the memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you leave Rochet?&#8221; inquired the Duchess, almost
incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave Rochet?&#8221; thought Nell, aghast. &#8220;I knew she would ask
me something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s awkwardness&#8211;Nell was on difficult ground.
She feared lest she might make a misstep which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_205'></a>205</span> would reveal her identity. The Duchess grew
impatient. Finally, Nell mustered courage and made a bold play for it, as ever
true to her brogue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did I leave Rochet?&#8221; she said, as if she had but then
realized the Duchess&#8217;s meaning, then boldly answered: &#8220;In
Cork.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Cork!&#8221; cried Portsmouth, in blank surprise. &#8220;I thought
his mission took him to Dublin.&#8221; She eyed the youth closely and wondered
if he really knew the mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; Cork!&#8221; firmly repeated Nell; for she dared not retract,
lest she awaken suspicion. &#8220;I am quite sure it was Cork I left him
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure?&#8221; exclaimed the Duchess, her astonishment increasing
with each confused reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Duchess,&#8221; said Nell, &#8220;we had an adventure.
It was dark; and we were more solicitous to know whither the way than
whence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess broke into a merry laugh. The youth had captured her, with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> wistful, Irish
eyes, his brogue and his roguish ways.</p>

<p>&#8220;We give a ball to-night,&#8221; she said, gaily. &#8220;You shall stay
and see the King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The King!&#8221; cried Nell, feigning fright. &#8220;I should tremble
so to see the King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not fear,&#8221; laughed the hostess. &#8220;He will not know
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust not, truly,&#8221; sighed Nell, with much meaning, as she
scanned her scanty masculine attire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my mask,&#8221; said the Duchess, graciously. &#8220;As hostess,
I cannot wear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell seized it eagerly. She would be safe with this little band of black
across her eyes. Even the King would not know her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall feel more comfortable behind this,&#8221; she said,
naïvely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever mask?&#8221; inquired Portsmouth, gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I am too honest to deceive,&#8221; answered Nell; and her eyes
grew so round and so big, who would not believe her?</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

AS A CAVALIER MISTRESS NELL DECEIVES EVEN THE KING.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;But you
are at court now,&#8221; laughed the Duchess, patronizingly. &#8220;Masking is
the first sin at court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll begin with the first sin,&#8221; said Nell, slyly,
raising the Duchess&#8217;s fingers to her lips, &#8220;and run the
gamut.&#8221;</p>

<p>They passed together into the great ball-room, Nell exercising all her arts
of fascination&#8211;and they were many. The music ceased as they entered. The
dancers, and more especially the ladies, eyed curiously the jaunty figure of the
new-comer. There were merry whisperings among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can he be?&#8221; asked one, eagerly. &#8220;What a pretty
fellow!&#8221; exclaimed a second, in admiration. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been eying
him,&#8221; said a third, complacently.</p>

<p>The men too caught the infection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can he be?&#8221; inquired Rochester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, I&#8217;ll find out,&#8221; said Lady Hamilton, with an air of
confidence, having recovered by this time from the kisses which had been thrust
upon her and being now ready for a new flirtation.</p>

<p>She approached Adair, artfully, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_208'></a>208</span> inquired: &#8220;Who art thou, my butterfly? Tell
me now, e&#8217;er I die.&#8221; Her attitude was a credit to the extremes of
euphuism.</p>

<p>There was general laughter at her presumptuous and effete pose and
phrase.</p>

<p>The ladies had gathered about the new hero, like bees about new clover. The
gallants stood, or sat as wall-flowers in a row, deserted. The King too had been
abandoned for the lion of the hour and sat disconsolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, jealous ones!&#8221; cried Lady Hamilton, reprovingly, then
continued, with a winning way: &#8220;I know thou art Apollo himself, good
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell smiled complacently, though she felt her mask, to assure herself that it
was firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apollo, truly,&#8221; she said, jauntily, &#8220;if thou art his lyre,
sweet lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton turned to the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, your grace,&#8221; she asked, languishingly, &#8220;tell us in a
breath, tell us, who is this dainty beau of the ball?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to know my guests,&#8221; answered Portsmouth, feigning
innocence, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
&#8220;with their vizors down? Nay, sweet sir, unmask and please the ladies.
I&#8217;faith, who art thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess was delighted. The popularity of the new-comer was lending a
unique novelty to her entertainment. She was well pleased that she had detained
Monsieur Adair. She thought she saw a jealous look in the King&#8217;s usually
carelessly indifferent gaze when she encouraged the affectionate glances of the
Irish youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;faith,&#8221; laughed Nell, in reply, &#8220;I know not,
Duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye hear?&#8221; said Portsmouth. &#8220;He knows not
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have a suspicion, Duchess,&#8221; sighed Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark ye,&#8221; laughed Portsmouth, with a very pretty pout, &#8220;he
has a suspicion, ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, you will tell?&#8221; protested Nell, as the ladies gathered
closer about her in eager expectation.</p>

<p>There was a unison of voices to the contrary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>&#8220;Trust us,
fair sir,&#8221; said one. &#8220;Oh, we are good at keeping secrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, &#8217;twixt you and me, I am&#8211;&#8221; began Nell; and she
hesitated, teasingly.</p>

<p>The group about grew more eager, more wild with curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&#8211;&#8221; they exclaimed together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Nell, &#8220;the Pied Piper of Hamlin
Town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rat-catcher,&#8221; cried Portsmouth. &#8220;Oh, oh,
oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a lifting of skirts, revealing many high-born insteps, and a
scramble for chairs, as the ladies reflected upon the long lines of rats in the
train of the mesmeric Pied Piper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flee, flee!&#8221; screamed Lady Hamilton, playfully. &#8220;He may
pipe us into the mountains after the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fill me with laughter, ladies,&#8221; said Portsmouth to her
guests. &#8220;The man does not live who can entrap me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman does,&#8221; thought Nell, as, mock-heroically, she placed
near her lips a reed-pipe which she had snatched from a musician in the midst of
the fun; and, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
whistling a merry tune which the pipe took no part in, she circled about the
room, making quite a wizard&#8217;s exit.</p>

<p>The ladies, heart and soul in the fun, fell into line and followed, as if
spell-bound by the magic of the Piper.</p>

<p>Charles, James, Rochester and the gallants, who remained, each of whom had
been in turn deserted by his fair lady, unmasked and looked at one another in
wonderment. Of one accord, they burst into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sublime audacity,&#8221; exclaimed Charles. &#8220;Who is this curled
darling&#8211;this ball-room Adonis? Ods-pitikins, we are in the sear and yellow
leaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly, Sire,&#8221; said James, dryly, &#8220;I myself prefer a
gathering of men only.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother James,&#8221; forthwith importuned the King, waggishly,
&#8220;will you favour me with your lily-white hand for the next dance? I am
driven to extremity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Sire,&#8221; replied James, quite humorously for him, &#8220;I
am engaged to a handsomer man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish,&#8221; laughed Charles, &#8220;King <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span> Charles of England a wall-flower. Come,
Rochester, my epitaph.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King threw himself into a chair, in an attitude of hopeless resignation,
quite delicious.</p>

<p>Rochester perked up with the conceit and humour of the situation. With the
utmost dignity, and with the quizzical, pinched brow of the labouring muse,
halting at each line, he said:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;Here lies our sovereign lord, the King,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose
word no man relies on;<br /> Who never said a foolish thing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never did a wise one!&#8221;</i></p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>The post-mortem verse was sufficiently subtle and clever to revive the
King&#8217;s drooping spirits; and he joined heartily in the applause.</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter,&#8221; he said, approvingly, &#8220;is easily accounted
for&#8211;my discourse is my own, my actions are my Ministry&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a <i>frou-frou</i> of petticoats. The hostess entered gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King! The courtiers! Unmasked!&#8221; she exclaimed, in coy
reproof. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
&#8220;Fy, fy, your Majesty! For shame! Gallants! Are you children that I must
pair you off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are seeking consolation,&#8221; suggested Charles, dryly;
&#8220;for modest souls have small chance to-night, Louise.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded significantly in the direction of the great ball-room, where the
chatter of women&#8217;s voices betokened the unrivalled popularity of Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you turn modest, Sire?&#8221; slyly inquired Portsmouth, with
a look of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was out-stripped in audacity by yon Hibernian youth,&#8221;
replied the King, seriously. &#8220;Who is this peacock you are
introducing?&#8221;</p>

<p>A peal of laughter from without punctuated the King&#8217;s speech. It was
the reward of a wit-thrust from Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Piper the maids would now unmask?&#8221; queried Portsmouth,
rapturously. &#8220;Marry, &#8217;tis the fascinating Beau Adair of Cork,
entertaining the ladies. Oh, he is a love, Sire; he does not sulk in corners.
See! See!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>She pointed
toward the archway, through which Nell was plainly visible. She was strutting
jauntily back and forth upon the promenade. It is unnecessary to say that she
was escorted by the assembled fair ones.</p>

<p>As Nell caught the eye of the hostess in the distance, she gaily tossed a
kiss to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath, that I were a woman to hope for one of his languishing
smiles,&#8221; observed Buckingham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even the old hens run at his call,&#8221; sneered the pious James, in
discontent; for he too had been deserted by his ladylove and even before the
others.</p>

<p>The King looked at his brother with an air of bantering seriousness, to the
delight of all assembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother James is jealous of the old ones only,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;You know his favourites are given him by his priests for
penance.&#8221;</p>

<p>A merry ripple ran through the group.</p>

<p>The hostess took advantage of the King&#8217;s speech to make a point.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>&#8220;And you
are jealous of the young ones only,&#8221; she said, slyly, quickly adding as a
bid for jealousy: &#8220;Pooh, pooh! <i>Le Beau</i> had letters to me, Sire.
Nay, we do not love him very much. We have not as yet had time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, alas,&#8221; sighed Charles, with drooping countenance,
&#8220;that it should come to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My liege, I protest&#8211;&#8221; cried Portsmouth, hastily, fearful
lest she might have gone too far. &#8220;To-night is the first I ever saw the
youth. I adore you, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word!&#8221; commanded Charles, with mock-heroic mien. He waved
his hand imperatively to his followers. &#8220;Friends,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;we will mix masks and dominoes and to&#8217;t again to drown our
sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Thames?&#8221; inquired James, facetiously for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush! In the punch-bowl, pious brother!&#8221; protested the Merry
Monarch, with great dignity. &#8220;You know, a very little water will drown
even a king.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gallants mixed masks and dominoes <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_216'></a>216</span> in obedience to the royal wish. The King, sighing
deeply, cast a hopeless glance at Portsmouth, not without its tinge of humour.
He then sauntered slowly toward the windows of the great ball-room, followed
subserviently by all the courtiers, save Buckingham, who was lost in converse
with player Hart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark ye,&#8221; suddenly broke off Buckingham, observing the approach
of Adair and his adorers, &#8220;here come again the merry maskers. By Bacchus,
the little bantam still reigns supreme. The King and his gallants in tears. Let
us join the mourners, Master Hart.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Duke and the player, the former assuming a fraternal air for an end of
his own, joined the royal group, Nell re-entered gaily, every inch the man. She
was still surrounded by the ladies, who, fluttering, flattering and chattering,
hung upon her every word. With one hand she toyed with her mask, which she had
good-naturedly dropped as none were about who knew her. She clapped it, however,
quickly to her eyes at sight of the King.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>&#8220;You
overwhelm me, my fair ones,&#8221; she said, with spirit, as she held court in
the centre of the room. &#8220;I assure you, I am not used to such
attention&#8211;from the ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our hospitality is beggarly to your deserts,&#8221; sighed Portsmouth,
who had joined the bevy, but loud enough for the King to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You quite o&#8217;erpower me, Duchess,&#8221; answered Nell, modestly,
adding for the satisfaction of her own sense of humour: &#8220;No wonder we men
are fools, if you women talk like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>While she was speaking, Lady Hamilton whispered facetiously in
Portsmouth&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beau Adair married!&#8221; exclaimed the Duchess, in response.
&#8220;It cannot be. He looks too gay for a married man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No confidences, my pretty ones,&#8221; observed Nell, reprovingly.</p>

<p>The hostess hesitated; then she out with it in a merry strain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Hamilton asks after the wife you left at home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>&#8220;My
wife!&#8221; cried Nell, in astonishment; for this phase of her masquerading had
not presented itself to her before. &#8220;Great Heavens, I have no wife&#8211;I
assure you, ladies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; observed Portsmouth, her curiosity awakened.
&#8220;Modest&#8211;for a bachelor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bachelor!&#8221; exclaimed Nell, now fully <i>en rapport</i> with
the spirit of the situation. &#8220;Well,&#8211;not exactly a bachelor
either,&#8211;ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alack-a-day,&#8221; sighed Lady Hamilton, with a knowing glance at her
companions, &#8220;neither a bachelor nor a married man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see&#8211;&#8221; explained Nell, adroitly, &#8220;that
might seem a trifle queer, but&#8211;I&#8217;m in mourning&#8211;deeply in
mourning, ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew a kerchief from her dress and feigned bitter tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;A widower!&#8221; tittered Lady Hamilton, heartlessly. &#8220;Our
united congratulations, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other ladies one by one sobbed <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_219'></a>219</span> with affected sympathy, wiping their eyes tenderly,
however, lest they might remove the rich colour from their cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mesdames,&#8221; said Nell, reprovingly, &#8220;the memory is sacred.
Believe me, very sacred.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fell apparently once again to weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The memory is always sacred&#8211;with men,&#8221; observed
Portsmouth, for the benefit of her guests, not excepting the Irish youth.
&#8220;Nay, tell us the name of the fair one who left you so young. My heart
goes out to you, dear Beau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind hostess,&#8221; replied Nell, assuming her tenderest tones,
&#8220;the name of my departed self is&#8211;Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart caught the word. The player was standing near, reflecting on the scene
and on the honeyed words of the Duke of Buckingham, who was preparing the way
that he might use him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Who spoke that name?&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess too was startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell!&#8221; she exclaimed, with contending <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span> emotions. &#8220;Strange! Another
cavalier who graces <i>mon bal masqué</i> to-night has lost a loved one whose
name is Nell. Ah, but she was unworthy of his noble love.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke pointedly at the masked King, who started perceptibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he thought; for his conscience smote him,
&#8220;unworthy&#8211;he of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unworthy, truly, if he dances so soon and his own Nell dead,&#8221;
added Nell, reflectively, but so that all might hear, more especially
Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perchance Nell too thinks so,&#8221; thought he, as he restlessly
walked away, sighing: &#8220;I wish I were with her on the terrace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath, Duchess,&#8221; continued Nell abruptly, in assumed horror at
the sudden thought, &#8220;the lady&#8217;s spirit may visit the ball, to the
confusion of us all. Such things have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Nell I mean,&#8221; said Portsmouth, with a confident smile,
&#8220;will not venture here, e&#8217;en in spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell assumed a baby-innocence of face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>&#8220;She has
not been bidden, I presume?&#8221; she queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;The vixen would not stop for asking,&#8221; declared Portsmouth,
almost fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come without asking?&#8221; cried Nell, as if she could not believe
that there could be such people upon the earth. &#8220;How ill-bred! Thine ear,
loved one. My Nell revisits the world again at midnight. The
rendezvous&#8211;St. James&#8217;s Park.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hart brushed close enough to the group, in his biting curiosity, to catch her
half-whisper to Portsmouth. He at once sought a window and fresh air, chafing
with surprise and indignation at what he had overheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. James&#8217;s at midnight,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;&#8217;Tis my
Nell&#8217;s abode.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess herself stood stunned at what appeared to her a possible
revelation of great import.</p>

<p>&#8220;St. James&#8217;s!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;Can he mean Madame Gwyn?
No, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>The look of suspicion which for an instant had clouded her face changed to
one of merriment, under Adair&#8217;s magic glance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>&#8220;And you
would desert me for such a fleshless sprite?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said Nell, with a winning look; &#8220;but, when my
better-half returns to life, I surely cannot refuse an
interview&#8211;especially an she come from afar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s eyes arose with an expression of sadness, while her finger
pointed down&#8211;ward in the direction of what she deemed the probable abode
of her departed &#8220;Nell.&#8221; Her lips twitched in merriment, however,
despite her efforts to the contrary; and the hostess fell a-laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies,&#8221; she cried, as she appealed to one and all, &#8220;is
not <i>le Beau</i> a delight&#8211;so different from ordinary men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not an ordinary man, I assure you,&#8221; Nell hastened to
declare.</p>

<p>This assertion was acquiesced in by a buzz of pretty compliments from the
entire bevy of ladies. &#8220;Positively charming!&#8221; exclaimed one.
&#8220;A perfect love!&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>Nell listened resignedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sheart,&#8221; she said, at length, with an air of <i>ennui</i>,
&#8220;I cannot help it. &#8217;Tis all <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_223'></a>223</span> part of being a man, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that all men were like you, <i>le Beau</i>!&#8221; sighed the
hostess, not forgetting to glance at the King, who again sat disconsolate, in
the midst of his attendant courtiers, drawn up, as in line of battle, against
the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven help us if they were!&#8221; slyly suggested Nell.</p>

<p>Rochester, who had been watching the scene in his mischievous, artistic way,
drew from Portsmouth&#8217;s compliment to Adair another meaning. He was a
mixture &#8217;twixt a man of arts and letters and Satan&#8217;s own&#8211;a man after
the King&#8217;s own heart. Turning to the King, with no desire to appease the
mischief done, he said, banteringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Egad, there&#8217;s a rap at you, Sire. France would make you
jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke of Buckingham too, though he appeared asleep, had seen it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;And succeeds, methinks,&#8221; he reflected, glancing approvingly in
the direction of the Irish youth. &#8220;A good ally, i&#8217;faith.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>Nell, indeed,
was using all her arts of fascination to ingratiate herself with the Duchess,
and making progress, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes are glorious, fair hostess,&#8221; she said, in her most
gallant love-tones, &#8220;did I not see my rival in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not, however, look at Portsmouth for laughter, as she thought:
&#8220;I believe lying goes with the breeches; I never was so proficient
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The compliment aroused the King&#8217;s sluggish nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can endure no more, gallants,&#8221; cried he, with some pretence of
anger, rising abruptly, followed, of course, in each move and grimace by his
courtier-apes, in their desire to please. &#8220;Are we to be out-done in our
own realm by this usurper with a brogue? Ha! The fiddlers! Madame, I claim the
honour of this fair hand for the dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of the music, he had stepped gallantly forward, taking the
hostess&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My thanks, gallant masker,&#8221; replied the Duchess, pretending not
to know <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span> him for
flattery&#8217;s sake, &#8220;but I am&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>To her surprise, she had no opportunity to complete the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Engaged! Engaged!&#8221; interposed Nell, coming unceremoniously
between them, with swaggering assumption and an eye-shot at the King through the
portal of her mask. &#8220;Forsooth, some other time, strange sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess stood horrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Sir Masker,&#8221; she hastened to explain; &#8220;but the
dance was pledged&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No apologies, Duchess,&#8221; replied the King, as he turned away,
carelessly, with the reflection: &#8220;All&#8217;s one to me at this
assemblage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the room, turning an instant to look, with a humorous, quizzical
glance, at Portsmouth. Nell mistook the glance for a jealous one and, perking up
quickly, caught the royal eye with a challenging eye, tapping her sword-hilt
meaningly. Had the masks been off, the situation would have differed. As it was,
the King smiled indifferently. The episode did not affect him further than to
touch his sense <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span> of
humour. Nell turned triumphantly to her partner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsbud,&#8221; she exclaimed, with a delicious, youthful swagger,
&#8220;we may have to measure swords in your behalf, dear hostess. I trow the
fellow loves you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care,&#8221; whispered the Duchess, nervously. &#8220;It is the
King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What care I for a king?&#8221; saucily replied Nell, with a
finger-snap. She had taken good care, however, to speak very low. &#8220;My arm,
my arm, Duchess!&#8221; she continued, with a gallant step. &#8220;Places,
places; or the music will outstrip us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strut on, my pretty bantam,&#8221; thought Buckingham, whose eyes lost
little that might be turned to his own advantage; &#8220;I like you
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no mending things at this stage by an apology. The Duchess,
therefore, tactfully turned the affair into one of mirth, in which she was
quickly joined by her guests. With a merry laugh, she took the Irish
gallant&#8217;s proffered arm, and together they led the dance. The <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span> King picked a lady
indifferently from among the maskers.</p>

<p>It was a graceful old English measure. Nell&#8217;s roguish wits, as well as
her feet, kept pace with the music. She assured her partner that she had never
loved a woman in all her life before and followed this with a hundred merry
jests and sallies, keyed to the merry fiddles, so full of blarney that all were
set a-laughing. Anon, the gallants drew their swords and crossed them in the
air, while the ladies tiptoed in and out. Nell&#8217;s blade touched the
King&#8217;s blade. When all was ended the swords saluted with a knightly
flourish, then tapped the floor.</p>

<p>There was an exultant laugh from one and all, and the dance was done.</p>

<p>Nell hastened to her partner&#8217;s side. She caught the Duchess&#8217;s
hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dance divinely, your grace,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A goddess on
tiptoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Beau Adair!&#8221; replied the Duchess, courtseying low; and her
eyes showed that she was not wholly displeased at the warmth of his youthful
adoration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>&#8220;Oh,
Duchess!&#8221; said Nell, fondly, acknowledging the salute.</p>

<p>The Duchess hastened to join his Majesty and together they threaded their way
through many groups.</p>

<p>Nell tossed her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I love her!&#8221; she muttered, veiling the sarcasm under her
breath.</p>

<p>She crossed the great room, her head erect. Her confidence was quite
restored. This had been the most difficult bit of acting she had ever done; and
how well it had been done!</p>

<p>The other dancers in twos and threes passed from the room in search of quiet
corners, in which to whisper nothings.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s eyes fell upon Strings, who had had a slight turn for the better
in the world and who now, in a dress of somewhat substantial green, was one of
the fiddlers at the Duchess&#8217;s ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, sirrah!&#8221; she said, sharply, as she planted herself
firmly before him to his complete surprise. &#8220;I knew you were
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She placed one of her feet in a devil-may-care <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span> fashion upon a convenient chair in
manly contempt of its upholstery and peeped amusedly through her mask at her old
friend. He looked at her in blank amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gads-bobbs,&#8221; he exclaimed, in confusion, &#8220;the Irish
gentleman knows me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like your old fiddle, Strings,&#8221; continued
Nell, still playing with delight upon his consternation. &#8220;It fills me with
forty dancing devils. If you were to play at my wake, I would pick up my shroud,
and dance my way into Paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship has danced to my fiddling before?&#8221; he gasped, in
utter amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danced!&#8221; gleefully cried Nell. &#8220;I have followed your bow
through a thousand jigs. To the devil with these court-steps. I&#8217;m for a
jig, jig, jig, jig, jig! Oh, I&#8217;m for a jig! Tune up, tune up, comrade; and
we&#8217;ll have a touch of the old days at the King&#8217;s House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The King&#8217;s House! Jigs!&#8221; exclaimed the fiddler, now beside
himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_230'></a>230</span>&#8220;Jigs!&#8221; chuckled Nell. &#8220;Jigs are
my line of business.&#8221;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>Oranges, will you have my oranges?<br /> &#160;<br /> Sweet as
love-lips, dearest mine,<br /> Picked by Spanish maids divine,&#8211;</i></p>
</div><!-- poetry -->

<p>The room had now quite cleared; and, protected by a friendly alcove, Nell
punctuated the old song with a few happily turned jig-steps. Strings looked at
her a moment in bewilderment: then his face grew warm with smiles; the mystery
was explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Nell, as I live,&#8221; he cried, joyously, &#8220;turned
boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil fly away with you, you old idiot! Boy, indeed!&#8221;
replied Nell, indignantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m a full-grown widower!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had removed her mask and was dancing about Strings gleefully.</p>

<p>There was the sound of returning voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oons, you will be discovered,&#8221; exclaimed Strings,
cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, I forgot,&#8221; whispered Nell, glancing over her shoulder.
&#8220;You may <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
have to help me out o&#8217; this scrape, Strings, before the night is
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can count on me, Mistress Nell, with life,&#8221; he replied,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you!&#8221; said Nell, in her sympathetic, hearty way. Her
mind reverted to the old days when Strings and she were at the King&#8217;s.
&#8220;Oh, for just one jig with no petticoats to hinder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell, despite herself, had fallen into an old-time jig, with much gusto, for
her heart was for a frolic always, when Strings, seized her arm in
consternation, pointing through the archway.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>She clapped her mask to her eyes and near tumbled through the nearest arras
out of the room in her eagerness to escape, dragging her ever-faithful comrade
with her.</p>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>For the glory of England?</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The King entered the room with his historic stride. His brow was clouded; but
it was all humorous pretence, for trifles were not wont to weigh heavily upon
his Majesty. With him came Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you forgive me, Sire?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I had promised the
dance to Beau Adair. I did not know you, Sire; you masked so
cleverly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath, fair flatterer!&#8221; replied the King. &#8220;I have lived
too long to worry o&#8217;er the freaks of women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The youth knew not to whom he spoke,&#8221; still pleaded Portsmouth.
&#8220;His introduction here bespeaks his pardon, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King looked sardonic, but his laugh had a human ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is too pretty to kill,&#8221; he declared, dramatically.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll forgive him <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_233'></a>233</span> for your sake. And now good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So soon?&#8221; asked Portsmouth, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is late,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while the King is here,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Night comes only
when he departs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your words are sweet,&#8221; said Charles, thoughtfully observing
her.</p>

<p>She sighed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My thoughts stumble in your speech,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I regret I
have not English blood within my veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The King would trust and love me then. He does not now. I am French
and powerless to do him good.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a touch of honest sadness in her speech which awakened the
King&#8217;s sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; he said hastily, to comfort her; &#8220;&#8217;tis thy
fancy. Thy entertainment hath made me grateful&#8211;to Louis and
Louise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think not of Louis and Louise,&#8221; she said, sadly and
reproachfully, &#8220;but of thy dear self and England&#8217;s glory. For shame!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span> Ah, Sire, my
childhood-dreams were of sunny France, where I was born; at Versailles&#8211;at
Fontainebleau among the monarch trees&#8211;my early womanhood sighed for love.
France gave me all but that. It came not till I saw the English King!&#8221;</p>

<p>The siren of the Nile never looked more bewitchingly beautiful than this
siren of France as she half reclined upon the couch, playing upon the
King&#8217;s heart with a bit of memory. His great nature realized her sorrow
and encompassed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And am I not good to thee, child?&#8221; he asked. He took her hand
and responded to her eyes, though not with the tenderness of love&#8211;the
tenderness for which she sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are good to none,&#8221; she replied, bitterly; &#8220;for you are
not good to Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak enigmas,&#8221; he said, curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten your promise?&#8221; she asked, na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; the passport, pretty one?&#8221; he answered, amused at the
woman&#8217;s wiles. &#8220;All this subterfuge of words for that! <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span> There; rest in peace.
Thy friend hath a path to France at will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled kindly as he took the passport from his girdle, handed it to her
and turned to take his leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;My thanks are yours. Stay, Sire,&#8221; she said, hastily; for her
mission was not yet complete and the night was now well gone. &#8220;Passports
are trifles. Will you not leave the Dutch to Louis and his army?
Think!&#8221;</p>

<p>She placed her arms about his neck and looked enticingly into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he replied, kindly, &#8220;my people demand that I
intervene and stay my brother Louis&#8217;s aggressive hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the people king?&#8221; she asked, with coy insinuation. &#8220;Do
they know best for England&#8217;s good? Nay, Sire, for your good and theirs, I
beseech, no more royal sympathy for Holland. I speak to avoid entanglements for
King Charles and to make his reign the greater. I love you, Sire.&#8221; She
fell upon her knee. &#8220;I speak for the glory of England.&#8221;</p>

<p>His Majesty was influenced by her <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_236'></a>236</span> beauty and her arts,&#8211;what man would not
be?&#8211;but more by the sense of what she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the glory of England?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;True, my
people are wrong. &#8217;Tis better we remain aloof. No wars!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the seat by the table, which the Duchess offered him, and scanned
casually the parchment which she handed to him.</p>

<p>Nell peered between the curtains. Strings was close behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bouillon&#8217;s signature for France,&#8221; mused the King.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis well! No more sympathy for the Dutch, Louise, until Holland sends a
beauty to our court to outshine France&#8217;s ambassador.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Portsmouth, smiled and signed the instrument, which had been
prepared, as he thought, in accordance with his wishes and directions. He then
carelessly tossed the sand over the signature to blot it.</p>

<p>The fair Duchess&#8217;s eyes revealed all the things which all the
adjectives of all the lands ever meant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>&#8220;Holland
may outshine in beauty, Sire,&#8221; she said, kneeling by the King&#8217;s
side, &#8220;but not in sacrifice and love.&#8221; She kissed his hand
fervently.</p>

<p>He sat complacently looking into her eyes, scarce mindful of her insinuating
arts of love. He was fascinated with her, it is true; but it was with her
beauty, flattery and sophistry, not her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe thou dost love England and her people&#8217;s good,&#8221;
he said, finally. &#8220;Thy words art wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth leaned fondly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;One more request,&#8221; she said, with modest mien, &#8220;a very
little one, Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King laughed buoyantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, an I stay here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thy beauty will win my
kingdom! What is thy little wish, sweet sovereign?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more Parliaments in England, Sire,&#8221; she said, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, woman!&#8221; he exclaimed, rising, half-aghast, half-humorous,
at the suggestion; for he too had an opinion of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>&#8220;To cross
the sway of thy great royal state-craft,&#8221; she continued, quickly following
up the advantage which her woman&#8217;s wit taught her she had gained.
&#8220;The people&#8217;s sufferings from taxation spring from Parliament only,
Sire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true,&#8221; agreed Charles, decisively.</p>

<p>Portsmouth half embraced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the people&#8217;s good, Sire,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;for my
sweetest kiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mad,&#8221; said Charles, yet three-fourths convinced;
&#8220;my people&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will be richer for my kiss,&#8221; the Duchess interrupted, wooingly,
&#8220;and their King, by divine right and heritage, will rule untrammelled by
country clowns, court knaves and foolish lords, who now make up a silly
Parliament. With such a King, England will be better with no Parliament to
hinder. Think, Sire, think!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of this before,&#8221; said Charles, who had often
found Parliament troublesome and, therefore, useless. &#8220;The taxes will be
less and contention saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hesitate then?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;This hour&#8217;s as good
for a good deed as any.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>&#8220;For
England&#8217;s sake?&#8221; reflected Charles, inquiringly, as he took the
second parchment from her hands. &#8220;Heaven direct my judgment for my
people&#8217;s good. I sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>The treaties which Louis XIV. of France had sent the artful beauty to procure
lay signed upon her desk.</p>

<p>Nell almost pulled the portières from their hangings in her excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see those papers,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
good brewing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth threw her arms about the King and kissed him passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, indeed, has England a great King,&#8221; she said, adding to
herself: &#8220;And that King Louis&#8217;s slave!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles smiled and took his leave. As he passed through the portal, he wiped
his lips, good-humouredly muttering: &#8220;Portsmouth&#8217;s kisses and
Nell&#8217;s do not mix well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth listened for a moment to his departing footsteps, then dropped
into the chair by the table and hastily folded and addressed the papers.</p>

<p>Her mission was ended!</p>

<p>Nell, half draped in the arras, had seen the kiss in reality bestowed by
Portsmouth but as she thought bestowed by the King. As his Majesty departed
through the door at the opposite end of the room, the colour came and went in
her cheeks. She could scarce breathe.</p>

<p>Portsmouth sat unconscious of all but her own grand achievement. She had
accomplished what shrewd statesmen had failed to bring about; and this would be
appreciated, she well knew, by Louis.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath!&#8221; muttered Nell to herself, hotly, as, with quite a
knightly bearing, she approached the Duchess. &#8220;He kisses her before my
very eyes! He kisses her! I&#8217;ll kill the minx!&#8221; She half unsheathed
her blade. &#8220;Pshaw! No! No! I am too gallant to kill the sex. I&#8217;ll do
the very manly act and simply break her heart. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_241'></a>241</span> Aye, that is true bravery in breeches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her manner changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grace!&#8221; she said suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Portsmouth, her eyes still gleaming
triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems you are partial of your favours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a gift from lips less fair,&#8221; continued Nell, all in wooing
vein, &#8220;would make a beggar royal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess was touched with the phrasing of the compliment. She smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be pleased to think me fair?&#8221; she coyly asked, with
the air of one convinced that it could not well be otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairer than yon false gallant thinks you,&#8221; cried Nell, with an
angry toss of the head in the direction of the departed King.
&#8220;Charles&#8217;s kiss upon her lips?&#8221; she thought. &#8220;&#8217;Tis mine,
and I will have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye, she threw both arms wildly about the neck of the
astonished hostess and kissed her forcefully upon the lips. Then, with a ringing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span> laugh, tinged with
triumph, she stepped back, assuming a defiant air.</p>

<p>The Duchess paled with anger. She rose quickly and, turning on the pretty
youth, exclaimed: &#8220;Sir, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tilly-vally!&#8221; replied the naughty Nell, in her most winning way.
&#8220;A frown upon that alabaster brow, a pout upon those rosy lips; and all
for nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Parbleu!</i>&#8221; exclaimed the indignant Duchess. &#8220;Your
impudence is outrageous, sir! We will dispense with your company. Good
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ods-pitikins!&#8221; swaggered Nell, feigning umbrage. &#8220;Angry
because I kissed you! You have no right, madame, to be angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No right?&#8221; asked Portsmouth, her feelings tempered by
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No right,&#8221; repeated Nell, firmly. &#8220;It is I who should be
outraged at your anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Explain, sir,&#8221; said the Duchess, haughtily.</p>

<p>Nell stepped toward the lady, and, assuming her most tender tone, with
wistful, loving eyes, declared:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>&#8220;Because
your grace can have no appreciation of what my temptation was to kiss
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess&#8217;s countenance glowed with delight, despite herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;faith, was there a temptation?&#8221; she asked, quite
mollified.</p>

<p>&#8220;An overwhelming passion,&#8221; cried Nell, following up her
advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you were disappointed, sir?&#8221; asked Portsmouth suggestively,
her vanity falling captive to the sweet cajolery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only got yon courtier&#8217;s kiss,&#8221; saucily pouted Nell,
&#8220;so lately bestowed on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know whose kiss that was?&#8221; inquired the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed familiar,&#8221; answered Nell, dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King&#8217;s,&#8221; said Portsmouth, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King&#8217;s!&#8221; cried Nell, opening wide her eyes.
&#8220;Take back your kiss. I would not have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Portsmouth, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis too volatile,&#8221; charged Nell, decisively. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span> &#8220;&#8217;Tis here,
&#8217;tis there, &#8217;tis everywhere bestowed. Each rosy tavern-wench with a
pretty ankle commands it halt. A kiss is the gift of God, the emblem of true
love. Take back the King&#8217;s kiss; I do not wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not love the King,&#8221; thought Portsmouth, ever on the
lookout for advantage. &#8220;A possible ally!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon the youth, with humorous, mocking lip, and said reprovingly:
&#8220;A kiss is a kiss the world over, fair sir; and the King&#8217;s kisses
are sacred to Portsmouth&#8217;s lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zounds,&#8221; replied Nell, with a wicked wink, &#8220;not two hours
since, he bestowed a kiss on Eleanor Gwyn&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell Gwyn!&#8221; cried the Duchess, interrupting; and she started
violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;With oaths, mountains high,&#8221; continued Nell, with pleasurable
harshness, &#8220;that his lips were only for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess stood speechless, quivering from top to toe.</p>

<p>Nell herself swaggered carelessly across the room, muttering mischievously,
as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span> she watched the
Duchess from the corner of her eye: &#8220;Methinks that speech went
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He kissed her in your presence?&#8221; gasped Portsmouth, anxiously
following her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not far off, dear Duchess,&#8221; was the quizzical reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw the kiss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nell, dryly, and she could scarce contain her
merriment. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;felt the shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she had finished the sentence, the King appeared in the doorway. His
troubled spirit had led him to return, to speak further with the Duchess
regarding the purport of the treaties. He had the good of his people at heart,
and he was not a little anxious in mind lest he had been over-hasty in signing
such weighty articles without a more careful reading. He stopped short as he
beheld, to his surprise, the Irish spark Adair in earnest converse with his
hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate Nell Gwyn,&#8221; he overheard the Duchess say.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_246'></a>246</span>&#8220;Is&#8217;t possible?&#8221; interrogated
Nell, with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>The King caught this utterance as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a passion over Nelly?&#8221; reflected he. &#8220;I&#8217;d sooner
face Cromwell&#8217;s soldiers at Boscobel! All hail the oak!&#8221;</p>

<p>His Majesty&#8217;s eye saw with a welcome the spreading branches of the
monarch of the forest, outlined on the tapestry; and, with a sigh of relief, he
glided quickly behind it and, joining a group of maskers, passed into an
anteroom, quite out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most strange!&#8221; continued Nell, wonderingly. &#8220;Nell told me
but yesterday that Portsmouth was charming company&#8211;but a small
eater.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis false,&#8221; cried the Duchess, and her brow clouded at the
unpleasant memory of the meeting at Ye Blue Boar. &#8220;I never met the
swearing orange-wench.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ods-pitikins!&#8221; acquiesced Nell, woefully. &#8220;Nell&#8217;s
oaths are bad enough for men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Masculine creature!&#8221; spitefully ejaculated the Duchess.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>&#8220;Verily,
quite masculine&#8211;of late,&#8221; said Nell, demurely, giving a significant
tug at her boot-top.</p>

<p>&#8220;A vulgar player,&#8221; continued the indignant Duchess, &#8220;loves
every lover who wears gold lace and tosses coins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; &#8217;tis false!&#8221; denied Nell, sharply.</p>

<p>The Duchess looked up, surprised.</p>

<p>Nell was all obeisance in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, dear hostess, a thousand pardons,&#8221; she prayed;
&#8220;but I have some reason to know you misjudge Mistress Nell. With all her
myriad faults, she never loved but one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem solicitous for her good name, dear Beau?&#8221; suggested
Portsmouth, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am solicitous for the name of all good women,&#8221; promptly
explained Nell, who was rarely caught a-napping, &#8220;or I would be unworthy
of their sex&#8211;I mean their friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess seemed satisfied with the explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Beau, what do the cavaliers see in that horrid creature?&#8221;
archly asked the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
Duchess, contemptuous of this liking of the stronger sex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alack-a-day, we men, you know,&#8221; replied Nell, boastfully,
&#8220;well&#8211;the best of us make mistakes in women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you mistaken?&#8221; questioned Portsmouth, coyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; laughed Nell, in high amusement. &#8220;I love Nelly?
Nay, Duchess,&#8221; and her voice grew tender, &#8220;I adore but
one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she?&#8221; asked the hostess, encouraging the youth&#8217;s
apparently awakening passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you ask?&#8221; said Nell, with a deep sigh, looking adoringly
into Portsmouth&#8217;s eyes and almost embracing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not fear?&#8221; inquired Portsmouth, well pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear what?&#8221; questioned Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wrath,&#8221; said Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, more, thy love!&#8221; sighed Nell, meaningly, assuming a true
lover&#8217;s dejected visage.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love!&#8221; cried Portsmouth, curiously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_249'></a>249</span>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; again sighed Nell, more deeply
still; &#8220;for it is hopeless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try,&#8221; said the Duchess, almost resting her head upon
Nell&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am doing my best,&#8221; said Nell, her eyes dancing through wistful
lashes, as she embraced in earnest the Duchess&#8217;s graceful figure and held
it close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you find it hopeless?&#8221; asked Portsmouth, returning the
embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Until you trust me,&#8221; replied Nell, sadly. She shook her curls,
then fondly pleaded: &#8220;Give me the secrets of your brain and heart, and
then I&#8217;ll know you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess smiled and withdrew from the embrace. Nell stood the picture of
forlorn and hopeless love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay,&#8221; laughed Portsmouth, consolingly, &#8220;they would sink a
ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One would not,&#8221; still pleaded Nell, determined at all odds to
have the packet.</p>

<p>&#8220;One!&#8221; The Duchess&#8217;s eyes fell unconsciously upon the
papers which she had bewitched from the King and which lay so near her heart.
She started first with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_250'></a>250</span> fear; and then her countenance assumed a thoughtful
cast.</p>

<p>There was no time now for delay. The papers must be sent immediately. The
King might return and retract. Many a battle, she knew, had been lost after it
had been won.</p>

<p>That night, at the Rainbow Tavern, well out of reach of the town, of court
spies and gossips, Louis would have a trusted one in waiting. His commission was
to receive news from various points and transmit it secretly to France. It was a
ride of but a few hours to him.</p>

<p>She had purposed to send the packet by her messenger in waiting; but he had
rendered her suspicious by his speech and action in the late afternoon, and she
questioned whether she would be wise in trusting him. Nor was she willing to
risk her triumph in the hands of Buckingham&#8217;s courier. It was too dear to
her.</p>

<p>Indeed, she was clever enough to know that state-secrets are often safer in
the custody of a disinterested stranger than in the hands of a friend,
especially if the stranger <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_251'></a>251</span> be truly a stranger to the court.</p>

<p>She glanced quickly in the direction of Nell, who looked the ideal of daring
youth, innocent, honest and true to the death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she thought quickly, as she reflected again upon
Rochet&#8217;s words, &#8220;to be trusted.&#8221; &#8220;Of Irish descent, no
love for the King, young, brave, no court ties; none will suspect or stay
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her woman&#8217;s intuition said &#8220;yes.&#8221; She turned upon Nell and
asked, not without agitation in her voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I trust you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s sword was out in an instant, glistening in the light, and so
promptly that the Duchess started. Nell saluted, fell upon one knee and said,
with all the exuberance of audacious, loving youth:</p>

<p>&#8220;My sword and life are yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Portsmouth looked deeply into Nell&#8217;s honest eyes. She was
convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;This little packet,&#8221; said she, in subdued tones, summoning Nell
to her side, &#8220;a family matter merely, must reach the Rainbow Tavern, on
the Canterbury <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
Road, by sunrise, where one is waiting. You&#8217;ll find his description on the
packet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell sheathed her sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the place and road,&#8221; she said, earnestly, as she took the
papers from the Duchess&#8217;s hand and placed them carefully in her
doublet.</p>

<p>A rustle of the curtains indicated that some one had returned and was
listening by the arras.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; cautioned Portsmouth. &#8220;Be true, and you will win my
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell did not reply, save to the glance that accompanied the words. Snatching
her hat from a chair on which she had tossed it, she started eagerly in the
direction of the great stairs that led to the hallway below, where, an hour
since, she had been at first refused admission to the palace. Could she but pass
again the guards, all would be well; and surely there was now no cause for her
detention. Yet her heart beat tumultuously&#8211;faster even than when she
presented herself with Rochet&#8217;s letter written by herself.</p>

<p>As she was hastening by the arras, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_253'></a>253</span> her quick eye, however, recognized the King&#8217;s
long plume behind it; and she halted in her course. She was alert with a
thousand maddening thoughts crowding her brain, all in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King returned&#8211;an eavesdropper!&#8221; she reflected.
&#8220;Jealous of Portsmouth; his eyes follow her. Where are his vows to Nell?
I&#8217;ll defame Nell&#8217;s name, drag her fair honour in the mire; so,
Charles, we&#8217;ll test your manliness and love.&#8221;</p>

<p>She recrossed the room quickly to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; she exclaimed, in crisp, nervous tones, loud enough for
the King&#8217;s ear, &#8220;I have been deceiving, lying to you. I stood here,
praising, honouring Eleanor Gwyn&#8211;an apple rotten to the core!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How now?&#8221; ejaculated Charles, in an undertone.</p>

<p>His carelessness vanished upon the instant. Where he had waited for the
single ear of Portsmouth, he became at once an earnest listener.</p>

<p>Nell paused not.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>&#8220;I had a
friend who told me he loved Nell. I loved that friend. God knows I loved
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; urged Portsmouth, with eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of noble name and princely mien,&#8221; continued Nell, so
standing that the words went, like arrows, straight to the King&#8217;s ear and
heart, &#8220;a man of honour, who would have died fighting for Nell&#8217;s
honour&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Misled youth,&#8221; muttered Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Nell seemed not to hear the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, had he heard a murmur of disapproval, a shadow cast upon her
name, would have sealed in death the presumptuous lips which uttered
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She betrayed his confidence?&#8221; asked Portsmouth,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betrayed&#8211;and worse!&#8221; gesticulated Nell, with the visage of
a madman. &#8220;A woman base, without a spark of kindliness&#8211;an
adventuress! This is the picture of that Eleanor Gwyn! Where is a champion to
take up the gauntlet for such a Nell?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>As quick as
light, the King threw back the arras and came between them. The Duchess saw him
and cried out in surprise. Nell did not turn&#8211;only caught a chair-top to
save herself from falling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, thou defamer!&#8221; he called, his voice husky with passion.
&#8220;Thou base purveyor of lies, answer me&#8211;me, for those words! I am
Nell&#8217;s champion! I&#8217;ll force you to own your slander a
lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King was terribly in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guard! The guard!&#8221; called Portsmouth, faintly, almost
overcome by the scene. In her passion that the King so revealed his love for
Nell, she quite forgot that Adair was the bearer of her packet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want no guard,&#8221; commanded the King. &#8220;An insult to Nell
Gwyn is my cause alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell was in an elysium of ecstasy. She realized nothing, saw nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He loves me! He loves me!&#8221; her trembling lips breathed only.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll fight for Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come; draw and defend yourself,&#8221; angrily cried the King.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>Portsmouth
screamed and fell upon his arm.</p>

<p>It is doubtful what the result would otherwise have been. True, Nell ofttimes
had fenced with the King and knew his wrist, but she was no swordswoman now.
Though she took up in her delirium the King&#8217;s challenge with a wild cry,
&#8220;Aye, draw and defend yourself!&#8221; she realized nothing but his
confession of love for Nell.</p>

<p>The scene was like a great blur before her eyes.</p>

<p>She rushed upon the King and by him, she scarce knew how. Their swords
harmlessly clashed; that was all.</p>

<p>The cries had been taken up without.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guard! The guard!&#8221; &#8220;Treason!&#8221;
&#8220;Treason!&#8221;</p>

<p>The air was alive with voices.</p>

<p>Nell ran up the steps leading to a French window, which opened upon a tiny
railed balcony. Below, one story only, lay a soft carpet of greensward,
shimmering in the moonlight. With her sword, she struck the frail sash, which
instantly yielded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>Meantime, the
room had filled with courtiers, guards and gallants, who had rushed in, sword
and spear in hand, to guard the King.</p>

<p>As the glass shivered and flew wide, under the point of Nell&#8217;s blade,
all eyes turned toward her and all blades quivered threateningly in the air.</p>

<p>Buckingham was first to ascend the steps in pursuit. He was
disarmed&#8211;more through the superiority of Nell&#8217;s position than
through the dexterity of her wrist.</p>

<p>Then for the first time, she realized her danger. Her eyes staring from their
sockets, she drew back from her murderous pursuers, and, in startled accents,
she knew not why, screamed in supplication, with hands uplifted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen! Gentlemen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The storm was stayed. All paused to hear what the stranger-youth would say.
Would he apologize or would he surrender?</p>

<p>The suspense was for but a second, though it seemed an eternity to Nell.</p>

<p>The open window was behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>With a parting
glance at the trembling blades, she turned quickly and with reckless daring
leaped the balcony.</p>

<p>&#8220;T&#8217; hell with ye!&#8221; was wafted back in a rich brogue
defiantly by the night.</p>

<p>Astonishment and consternation filled the room; but the bird had flown. Some
said that the wicked farewell-speech had been Adair&#8217;s, and some said
not.</p>

<p>How it all happened, no one could tell, unless it was a miracle.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>I come, my love; I come.</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>One lonely candle, or to speak more strictly a bit of one, sputtered in its
silver socket in the cosy drawing-room; and a single moonbeam found its way in
through the draperies of the window leading to the terrace and to St.
James&#8217;s Park.</p>

<p>Moll lay upon a couch asleep; but it was a restless sleep.</p>

<p>The voice of a town-crier resounded faintly across the park: &#8220;Midnight;
and all is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started up and rubbed her eyes in a bewildered way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The midnight crier!&#8221; she thought; and there was a troubled
expression in her face. &#8220;I have been asleep and the candle&#8217;s nearly
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>She jumped to her feet and hastily lighted two or three of its more
substantial mates, of which there was an abundance <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span> in the rich candelabra about the
room.</p>

<p>A cricket in a crevice startled her. She ran to the window and looked
anxiously out upon the park, then hastened to the door, with equal anxiety, lest
it might be unlocked. Every shadow was to her feverish fancy a spirit of evil or
of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish Nell would come,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;The ghosts and
skeletons fairly swarm in this old house at midnight; and I am all alone
to-night. It&#8217;s different when Nell&#8217;s about. The goblins are afraid
of her merry laugh. Boo! I am cold all over. I am afraid to stand still, and I
am afraid to move.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran again to the window and this time pulled it open. The moonlight
instantly flooded the room, dimming the candles which she had lighted. She saw
her shadow, and started back in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one glided behind the old oak in the park,&#8221; she cried
aloud, for the company of her voice. &#8220;Oh, oh! Nell will be murdered! I
begged her not to go to Portsmouth&#8217;s ball. She said she just wanted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span> peep in and pay
her respects to the hostess. Moll! You better pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees and reverently lifted her hands and eyes in
prayer.</p>

<p>Something fell in the room with a heavy thud. She shut her eyes tight and
prayed harder. The object of her fear was a long gray boot, which had been
thrown in at the window and had fallen harmlessly by her side. It was followed
in an instant by its mate, equally harmless yet equally dreadful.</p>

<p>A jaunty figure, assisted by a friendly shoulder, then bounded over the
balustrade and rested with a sigh of relief just within the window-opening. It
was Nell, returning from the wars; she was pale, almost death-like. The
evening&#8217;s excitement, her daring escapade and more especially its exciting
finish had taken hold of her in earnest. Her dainty little self was paying the
penalty. She was all of a tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe home at last!&#8221; she cried wearily. &#8220;Heaven reward you,
Strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>From below the terrace, without the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_262'></a>262</span> window, responded the fiddler, in sympathetic,
loving tones: &#8220;Good night, Mistress Nell; and good sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, comrade,&#8221; answered Nell, as she almost fell into the
room, calling faintly: &#8220;Moll! Moll! What are you doing, Moll?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll closed her eyes tighter and prayed still more fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Praying for Nell,&#8221; her trembling lips mechanically replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; cried Nell, half fainting, throwing herself upon the
couch. &#8220;There&#8217;s no spirit in this flesh worth praying for. Some
wine, some wine; and the blessing after.&#8221;</p>

<p>The command brought Moll to her senses and she realized that it was really
Nell who had entered thus unceremoniously. She rushed to her for safety, like a
frightened deer to the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, dear Nell!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You are ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wine, wine, I say,&#8221; again fell in peremptory tones from the
half-reclining Nell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>Moll glanced in
dismay at her bootless mistress: her garments all awry; her sword ill sheathed;
her cloak uncaught from the shoulder and half used, petticoat-like, as a
covering for her trembling-limbs; her hair dishevelled; her cheeks pale; her
wild eyes, excitement-strained, staring from their sockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wounded; you are going to die,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Moll
will be all alone in the world again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hands shook more than Nell&#8217;s as she filled a glass half full of
wine and passed it to her mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the brim, girl, to the brim,&#8221; commanded Nell, reviving at the
prospect of the draught. &#8220;There!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tossed off the drink in gallant fashion: &#8220;I tell you, sweetheart,
we men need lots of stimulating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all of a tremble,&#8221; continued Moll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little wonder!&#8221; sighed Nell. &#8220;These braveries are a trifle
chilly, sweet mouse. Boo!&#8221; She laughed hysterically, while Moll closed the
window. &#8220;You see, I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_264'></a>264</span> never was a man before, and I had all that lost
time to make up&#8211;acres of oats to scatter in one little night. Open my
throat; I cannot breathe. Take off my sword. The wars are done, I hope.&#8221;
She startled Moll, who was encasing her mistress&#8217;s pretty feet in a pair
of dainty shoes, with another wild, hilarious laugh. &#8220;Moll,&#8221; she
continued, &#8220;I was the gayest mad-cap there. The sex were wild for me. I
knew their weak points of attack, lass. If I had been seeking a mate, I could
have made my market of them all and started a harem.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed to forget all her dangers past in the recollection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wicked girl,&#8221; said Moll, pouting reprovingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am a jolly roisterer, little one,&#8221; laughed Nell, in reply,
as with cavalier-strides she crossed the room. She threw herself upon the table
and proceeded to boast of her doings for Moll&#8217;s benefit, swinging her feet
meanwhile. &#8220;I ran the gamut. I had all the paces of the truest cavalier. I
could tread a measure, swear <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_265'></a>265</span> like one from the wars, crook my elbow, lie,
gamble, fight&#8211;Fight? Did I say fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hid her curly head in her hands and sobbed spasmodically.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in danger!&#8221; exclaimed Moll, fearfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger!&#8221; repeated Nell, breaking out afresh. &#8220;I taught the
King a lesson he will dream about, my sweet, though it near cost me my life. He
loves me, d&#8217;ye hear; he loves me, pretty one! Dance, Moll,
dance&#8211;Dance, I say! I could fly for very joy!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the tears still wet upon her cheeks, she seized Moll by both hands and
whirled the astonished girl wildly about the room, until she herself reeled for
want of breath. Then, catching at a great carved oaken chair, she fell into it
and cried and laughed alternately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, Nell,&#8221; gasped Moll, as she too struggled for breath;
&#8220;one minute you laugh and then you cry. Have you lost your
wits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know,&#8221; exulted Nell, &#8220;I made <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span> him swear his love for Nell to
Portsmouth&#8217;s face. I made him draw his sword for Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Heavens!&#8221; exclaimed Moll, aghast. &#8220;You did not draw
yourself? A sword against the King is treason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ods-bodikins, I know not!&#8221; answered Nell. &#8220;I know not what
I did or said. I was mad, mad! All I remember is: there was a big noise&#8211;a
million spears and blunderbusses turned upon poor me! Gad! I made a pretty
target, girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A million spears and blunderbusses!&#8221; echoed Moll, her eyes like
saucers.</p>

<p>&#8220;An army, child, an army!&#8221; continued Nell, in half-frantic
accents. &#8220;I did not stop to count them. Then, next I knew, I was in my
coach, with dear old Strings beside me. The horses flew. We alighted at the
Chapel, tiptoed about several corners to break the scent; then I took off my
shoes and stole up the back way like a good and faithful husband. Oh, I did the
whole thing in cavalier-style, sweetheart. But, &#8217;twixt us, Moll,&#8221; and she
spoke with a mysterious, confidential air,&#8220;&#8211;I <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span> wouldn&#8217;t have it go further for
worlds&#8211;Adair is a coward, a monstrous coward! He ran!&#8221;</p>

<p>As if to prove the truth of her words, at a sudden, sharp, shrill sound from
the direction of the park, the sad remnant of Adair clutched Moll frantically;
and both girls huddled together with startled faces and bated breaths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! What is that?&#8221; whispered Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men, perchance, I told you of,&#8221; answered Moll;
&#8220;they&#8217;ve spied about the house for weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, you little goose,&#8221; remonstrated Nell, though none too
bravely; &#8220;some of your ex-lovers nailing their bleeding hearts to the
trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; listen!&#8221; exclaimed Moll, frantically, as the noise grew
louder. &#8220;They&#8217;re in the entry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the entry!&#8221; stammered Nell; and she almost collapsed at the
thought of more adventures. &#8220;I wish we were in bed, with our heads under
the sheet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is your sword,&#8221; said Moll, as she <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span> brought Nell the sharp weapon, held
well at arm&#8217;s length for fear of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, my sword!&#8221; exclaimed Nell, perking up&#8211;for an
instant only. &#8220;I never thought of my sword; and this is one of the bravest
swords I ever drew. I am as weak as a woman, Moll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take heart,&#8221; said Moll, encouraging her from the rear, as Nell
brandished the glittering blade in the direction of the door. &#8220;You know
you faced an army to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; replied Nell, her courage oozing out at her finger-tips,
&#8220;but then I was a man, and had to seem brave, whether I was or no.
Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; she called faintly. &#8220;Who&#8217;s there? Support
me, Moll. Beau Adair is on his last legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both stood listening intently and trembling from top to toe.</p>

<p>A score of rich voices, singing harmoniously, broke upon the night.</p>

<p>The startled expression on Nell&#8217;s face changed instantly to one of
fearless, roguish merriment. She was her old self again. She tossed the sword
contemptuously <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
upon the floor, laughing in derision now at her companion&#8217;s fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;A serenade! A serenade!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Moll&#8211;Why, Moll,
what feared ye, lass? Come!&#8221; She ran gaily to the window and peeped out.
&#8220;Oh, ho, masqueraders from the moon. Some merry crew, I&#8217;ll be bound.
I am generous. I&#8217;ll give thee all but one, sweet mouse. The tall knight in
white for me! I know he&#8217;s gallant, though his vizor&#8217;s down. Marry,
he is their captain, I trow; and none but a captain of men shall be captain of
my little heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Satan and his imps,&#8221; cried Moll, attempting to draw Nell
from the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush, little one,&#8221; laughed Nell, reprovingly. &#8220;Satan is my
warmest friend. Besides, they cannot cross the moat. The ramparts are ours. The
draw-bridge is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a merry mood, she threw a piece of drapery, mantle-like, about
Adair&#8217;s shoulders, quite hiding them, and, decapitating a grim old suit of
armour, placed the helmet on her head. Thus garbed, she threw the window quickly
open and stepped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
boldly upon the ledge, within full view of the band beneath. As the moonlight
gleamed upon her helmet, one might have fancied her a goodly knight of yore;
and, indeed, she looked quite formidable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, what are you doing?&#8221; called Moll, wildly, from a point of
safety. &#8220;They can see and shoot you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tilly-vally, girl,&#8221; replied Nell, undaunted now that she could
see that there was no danger, &#8220;we&#8217;ll parley with the enemy in true
feudal style. We&#8217;ll teach them we have a man about the house. Ho, there,
strangers of the night&#8211;breakers of the King&#8217;s peace and the slumbers
of the righteous! Brawlers, knaves; would ye raise honest men from their beds at
such an hour? What means this jargon of tipsy voices? What want ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>A chorus of throats without demanded, in muffled accents:
&#8220;Drink!&#8221; &#8220;Drink!&#8221; &#8220;Sack!&#8221;
&#8220;Rhenish!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye think this a tavern, knaves?&#8221; responded Nell, in a husky,
mannish voice. &#8220;Do ye think this a vintner&#8217;s? There are no topers
here. Jackanapes, revellers; away with you, or we&#8217;ll rouse the citadel and
train the guns.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;I WAS THAT BOY!&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>Her retort was
met with boisterous laughter and mocking cries of &#8220;Down with the
doors!&#8221; &#8220;Break in the windows!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a move Nell had not anticipated. She jumped from the ledge, or
rather tumbled into the room, nervously dropping her disguise upon the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven preserve us,&#8221; she said to Moll, with quite another
complexion in her tone, &#8220;they are coming in! Oh, Moll, Moll, I did not
think they would dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll closed the sashes and bolted them, then hugged Nell close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, there, within!&#8221; came, in a guttural voice, now from without
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Nell tried to say; but the word scarce went beyond her
lips.</p>

<p>Again in guttural tones came a second summons&#8211;&#8220;Nell!
Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell turned to Moll for support and courage, whispering: &#8220;Some arrant
knave calls Nell at this hour.&#8221; Then, assuming an attitude of bravery,
with fluttering heart, she answered, as best she could, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span> in a forced voice: &#8220;Nell&#8217;s
in bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Nell&#8217;s in bed,&#8221; echoed the constant Moll.
&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s in bed. Call to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No trifling, wench!&#8221; commanded the voice without, angrily.
&#8220;Down with the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand close, Moll,&#8221; entreated Nell, as she answered the would-be
intruder with the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are ye? Who are ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Rowley himself!&#8221; replied the guttural voice.</p>

<p>This was followed by hoarse laughter from many throats.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King&#8211;as I thought!&#8221; whispered Nell. &#8220;Good lack;
what shall I do with Adair? Plague on&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll be mad if I keep him
waiting, and madder if I let him in. Where are your wits, Moll? Run for my gown;
fly&#8211;fly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll hastened to do the bidding.</p>

<p>Nell rushed to the entry-door, in frantic agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bolt sticks, Sire,&#8221; she called, pretending to struggle with
the door, hoping <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
so to stay his Majesty until she should have time to dispose of poor Adair.
&#8220;How can I get out of these braveries?&#8221; she then asked herself,
tugging awkwardly at one part of the male attire and then at another. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know which end of me to begin on first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll re-entered the room with a bundle of pink in her arms, which turned out
to be a flowing, silken robe, trimmed with lace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the first I found,&#8221; she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>Nell motioned to her nervously to put it upon the couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me out of this coat,&#8221; she pleaded woefully.</p>

<p>Moll took off the coat and then assisted Nell to circumscribe with the gown,
from heels to head, her stunning figure, neatly encased in Adair&#8217;s habit,
which now consisted only of a jaunty shirt of white, gray breeches, shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, I would I were a fairy with a magic wand; I could befuddle
men&#8217;s eyes easier,&#8221; Nell lamented.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>The King knocked
again upon the door sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience, my liege,&#8221; entreated Nell, drawing her gown close
about her and muttering with personal satisfaction: &#8220;There, there; that
hides a multitude of sins. The girdle, the girdle! Adair will not escape from
this&#8211;if we can but keep him quiet; the rogue has a woman&#8217;s tongue,
and it will out, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She snatched up a mirror and arranged her hair as best she could in the dim
light, with the cries without resounding in her ears and with Moll dancing
anxiously about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with the door,&#8221; threatened the King, impatiently.
&#8220;The ram; the battering ram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come, my love; I come,&#8221; cried Nell, in agitation, fairly
running to the door to open it, but stopping aghast as her eye caught over her
shoulder the sad, telltale condition of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath,&#8221; she called in a stage-whisper to Moll; &#8220;under
the couch with Adair&#8217;s coat! Patience, Sire,&#8221; she besought <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span> in turn the King.
&#8220;Help me, Moll. How this lock has rusted&#8211;in the last few minutes. My
sword!&#8221; she continued breathlessly to Moll. &#8220;My boots! My hat! My
cloak!&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll, in her efforts to make the room presentable, was rushing hither and
thither, first throwing Adair&#8217;s coat beneath the couch as Nell commanded
and firing the other evidences of his guilty presence, one behind one door and
another behind another.</p>

<p>It was done.</p>

<p>Nell slipped the bolt and calmly took a stand in the centre of the room,
drawing her flowing gown close about Adair&#8217;s person. She was quite
exhausted from the nervous strain, but her actress&#8217;s art taught her the
way to hide it. Moll, panting for breath, across the room, feigned composure as
best she could.</p>

<p>The door opened and in strode the King and his followers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome, royal comrades, welcome all!&#8221; said Nell, bowing
graciously to her untimely visitors.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>Ods-pitikins, my own reflection!</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>Upon the fine face of the King, as he entered Nell&#8217;s drawing-room, was
an expression of nervous bantering, not wholly unmixed with anxiety.</p>

<p>The slanderous Adair and his almost miraculous escape had not long weighed
upon his Majesty&#8217;s careless nature.</p>

<p>As he had not met Adair until that night or even heard of him, his heart had
told him that the Irish roisterer could scarcely be a serious obstacle in the
way of Nell&#8217;s perfect faith, if, indeed, he had met Nell at all, which he
doubted. His command to the guard to follow and overtake the youth had been more
the command of the ruler than of the man. Despite himself, there had been
something about the dainty peacock he could not help but like; and the bold dash
for the window, the disarming of the purse-proud Buckingham, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span> who for many reasons
displeased him, and the leap to the sward below, with the accompanying farewell,
had especially delighted both his manhood and his sense of humour.</p>

<p>He had, therefore, dismissed Adair from his mind, except as a possible
subject to banter Nell withal, or as a culprit to punish, if overtaken.</p>

<p>His restless spirit had chafed under the Duchess&#8217;s lavish
entertainment&#8211;for the best entertainment is dull to the lover whose
sweetheart is absent&#8211;and he had turned instinctively from the ball to
Nell&#8217;s terrace, regardless of the hour and scarce noticing his constant
attendants.</p>

<p>The night was so beautiful that their souls had found vent in song.</p>

<p>This serenade, however, had brought to Nell&#8217;s window a wide-awake
fellow, who had revealed himself in saucy talk; and the delighted cavaliers, in
hope of fun, had charged jeeringly that they had outwitted the guard and had
found Adair.</p>

<p>It was this that had brought the anxious look to the King&#8217;s face; and,
though his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span> better
judgment was still unchanged, the sight of the knave at the window, together
with the suggestions of his merry followers, had cast a shadow of doubt for the
moment upon his soul, and he had reflected that there was much that the Irish
youth had said that could not be reconciled with that better judgment.</p>

<p>With a careless shrug, he had, therefore, taken up the jest of his lawless
crew, which coincided with his own intended purpose, and had sworn that he would
turn the household out of bed without regard to pretty protests or formality of
warrant. He would raise the question forthwith, in jest and earnest, and worry
Nell about the boaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scurvy entertainment,&#8221; he began, with frowning brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, my liege,&#8221; explained Nell, winsomely; &#8220;you
see&#8211;I did not expect the King so late, and so was
unpresentable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the one you do not expect,&#8221; replied Charles, dryly,
&#8220;who always causes the trouble, Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were in bed, Sire,&#8221; threw in Moll, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span> thinking to come to the rescue of her
mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, truly,&#8221; said Nell, catching at the cue,
&#8220;&#8211;asleep, Sire, sound asleep; and our prayers said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tilly-vally,&#8221; exclaimed the King, &#8220;we might credit thy
tongue, wench, but for the prayers. No digressions, spider Nell. My sword is in
a fighting mood. &#8217;Sdeath, call forth the knight-errant who holds thy errant
heart secure for one short hour!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The knight of my heart!&#8221; cried Nell. &#8220;Ah, Sire, you know
his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at his Majesty with eyes of unfailing love; but the King was true
to his jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, marry, I do,&#8221; laughed Charles, tauntingly, with a wink at
his companions; &#8220;a pretty piece of heraldry, a bold escutcheon, a dainty
poniard&#8211;pale as a lily, and how he did sigh and drop his lids and smirk
and smirk and dance your latest galliard to surpass De Grammont. Ask brother
James how he did dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Sire,&#8221; hastily interceded the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span> ever-gallant Rochester, &#8220;his
Highness of York has suffered enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>York frowned at the reference; for he had been robbed of his lady at the
dance by Adair. He could not forget that. Heedless of his royalty, bestowed by
man, she, like the others, had followed in the train of the Irish spark, who was
royal only by nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang the coxcomb!&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife, I will,&#8221; replied Charles, slyly, &#8220;an you overtake
him, brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His back was shapely, Sire,&#8221; observed Rochester, with quaint
humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, and his heels!&#8221; cried the King, reflectively. &#8220;He had
such dainty heels&#8211;Mercury&#8217;s wings attached, to waft him on his
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is moonshine madness!&#8221; exclaimed Nell, with the blandest of
bland smiles. &#8220;There&#8217;s none such here. By my troth, I would there
were. Nay, ask Moll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moll did not wait to be asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one visitor to-night,&#8221; she asserted promptly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_281'></a>281</span>&#8220;Odso!&#8221; cried Charles, in a mocking
tone. &#8220;Whence came the Jack at the window&#8211;the brave young
challenger&#8211;&#8216;Would ye raise honest men from their beds at such an
hour?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of laughter followed the King&#8217;s grave imitation of the
window-boaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire!&#8221; sighed Rochester, in like spirit. &#8220;&#8216;Do you think
this a vintner&#8217;s? There are no topers here.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Another burst of merry laughter greeted the speaker, as he punctuated his
words by catching up the wine-cups from the table and clinking them gaily.</p>

<p>Nell&#8217;s face was as solemn as a funeral.</p>

<p>&#8220;To your knees, minx,&#8221; commanded James, grimly, &#8220;and crave
mercy of your prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith and troth,&#8221; pleaded Nell, seriously, &#8220;&#8217;t was I
myself with helmet and mantle on. You see, Sire, my menials were guests at
Portsmouth&#8217;s ball&#8211;to lend respectability.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saucy wag,&#8221; cried the Merry Monarch. &#8220;A ball?&#8211;A
battle&#8211;which would have killed thee straight!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>&#8220;It had
liked to,&#8221; reflected Nell, as she tartly replied: &#8220;A war of the sex
without me? It was stupid, then. The Duchess missed me, I trow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never fear,&#8221; answered Charles, with difficulty suppressing his
mirth; &#8220;you were bravely championed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of that,&#8221; said Nell, slyly; &#8220;my King was
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a bantam cock,&#8221; ejaculated Charles, sarcastically,
&#8220;upon whose lips &#8216;Nell&#8217; hung familiarly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some strange gallant,&#8221; cried Nell, in ecstasy, &#8220;took my
part before them all? Who was he, Sire? Don&#8217;t tantalize me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, half serious, half humorous, as she pleaded in her charming
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chip from the Blarney Stone,&#8221; observed the King at length,
ironically, &#8220;surnamed Adair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair! Adair!&#8221; cried Nell, to the astonishment of all. &#8220;We
spent our youth together. I see him in my mind&#8217;s eye, Sire, throw down the
gauntlet in Nell&#8217;s name and defy the world for her. Fill the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span> cups. We&#8217;ll drink
to my new-found hero! Fill! Fill! To Beau Adair, as you love me, gallants! Long
life to Adair!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cups were filled to overflowing and trembled on eager lips in response to
the hostess&#8217;s merry toast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay!&#8221; commanded the King, in peremptory tones. &#8220;Not a
drop to a coward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A coward!&#8221; cried Nell, aghast. &#8220;Adair a coward? I&#8217;ll
never credit it, Sire!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away, lest she reveal her merriment, as she bethought her:
&#8220;He is trembling in my boots now. I can feel him shake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our pledge is Nell, Nell only!&#8221; exclaimed the King, his cup high
in air.</p>

<p>With one accord, the gallants eagerly took up the royal pledge. &#8220;Aye,
aye, Nell!&#8221; &#8220;Nell!&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;ll drink to
Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do me honour, royal gentlemen,&#8221; bowed Nell, well pleased at
the King&#8217;s toast.</p>

<p>She had scarce touched the cup to her lips, however, with a mental chuckle,
&#8220;Poor Adair! Here&#8217;s a health to the inner man!&#8221; when her eye
fell upon one of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
Adair&#8217;s gray boots, which Moll had failed to hide, in her excitement, now
revealing itself quite plainly in the light of the many candles. She caught it
adroitly on the tip of her toe and sent it whizzing through the air in the
direction of poor Moll, who, fortunately, caught it in midair and hid it quickly
beneath her apron.</p>

<p>The King turned at the sound; but Nell&#8217;s face was as woefully
unconcerned as a church-warden&#8217;s at his hundredth burial.</p>

<p>The wine added further zest to the merry-making and the desire for sport.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, fair huswife,&#8221; continued Charles, his thoughts reverting to
Adair, &#8220;set forth the dish, that we may carve it to our liking. &#8217;Tis a
dainty bit,&#8211;lace, velvet and ruffles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heyday, Sire,&#8221; responded Nell, evasively, &#8220;the
larder&#8217;s empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Devil on&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Charles, ferociously; &#8220;no
mincing, wench. In the confusion of the ball, the bird escaped my guard by
magic. We know whither the flight.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>The King assumed
a knowing look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Escaped the guard?&#8221; gasped Nell, in great surprise. &#8220;Alas,
I trow some petticoat has hid him then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stake my life upon&#8217;t,&#8221; observed James, who had
not been heard from in some time but who had been observing the scene with
decorous dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire, you would not injure Adair,&#8221; pleaded Nell, now alert, with
all her arts of fascination. &#8220;You are too generous. Blue eyes of heaven,
and such a smile! Did you mark that young Irishman&#8217;s smile,
Sire?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her impudence was so bewitching that the King scarce knew whether it were
jest or earnest. He sprang to his feet from the couch, where he had thrown
himself after the toast to Nell, and, with some forcefulness, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsfish, this to my teeth, rogue! Guard the doors, gallants;
we&#8217;d gaze upon this paragon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And set him pirouetting, Sire,&#8221; sardonically suggested
James.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, to the tune of these fiddle-sticks,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span> laughed Charles, as he unsheathed his
rapier. &#8220;Search from tile to rafter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye,&#8221; echoed the omnipresent Rochester, &#8220;from cellar
to garret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before, however, the command could be obeyed, even in resolution, Nell moved
uneasily to a curtain which hung in the corner of the room and placed herself
before it, as if to shield a hidden man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire,&#8221; she pleaded fearfully, &#8220;spare him, Sire; for my
sake, Sire. He is not to blame for loving me. He cannot help it. You know that,
Sire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can he really be here?&#8221; muttered Charles, with clouding visage.
&#8220;Saucy wench! Hey! My blood is charging full-tilt through my veins.
Odsfish, we&#8217;ll try his mettle once again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prythee, Sire,&#8221; begged Nell, &#8220;he is too noble and brave
and handsome to die. I love his very image.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; cried Charles. &#8220;A silken blind for the silken
bird! Hey, St. George for merry England! Come forth, thou picture of cowardice,
thou vile slanderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grasped Nell by the wrist and fairly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_287'></a>287</span> dragged her across the room. Then, rushing to the
curtain, he seized its silken folds and tore it completely from its
hangings&#8211;only to face himself in a large mirror. &#8220;Ods-pitikins, my
own reflection!&#8221; he exclaimed, with menacing tone, though there was relief
as well in his voice. He bent the point of his blade against the floor, gazed at
himself in the pier-glass and looked over his shoulder at Nell, who stood in the
midst of his courtiers, splitting her sides with laughter, undignified but
honest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rogue, rogue,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I should turn the point on thee
for this trick; but England would be worse than a Puritan funeral with no Nell.
Thou shalt suffer anon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I defy thee, Sire, and all thy imps of Satan,&#8221; laughed the
vixen, as she watched the King sheathe his jewelled sword. &#8220;Cast Nell in
the blackest dungeon, Adair is her fellow-prisoner; outlaw Nell, Adair is her
brother outlaw; off with Nell&#8217;s head, off rolls Adair&#8217;s. Who else
can boast so true a love!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>&#8220;Thou
shalt be banished the realm,&#8221; decided the King, jestingly; for he was now
convinced that her Adair was but a jest to tease him&#8211;a Roland for his
Oliver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Banished!&#8221; cried Nell, with bated breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye; beyond sea, witch!&#8221; answered the King, with pompous
austerity. &#8220;Virginia shall be thy home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, good!&#8221; laughed Nell, gaily. &#8220;Sire, the men grow
handsome in Virginia, and dauntless; and they tell me there are a dearth of
women there. Oh, banish me at once to&#8211;What&#8217;s the name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jamestown,&#8221; suggested York, recalling the one name because of
its familiar sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, brother James,&#8221; said Nell, fearlessly mimicking his brusque
accent, &#8220;Jamestown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Savages, wild men, cannibals,&#8221; scowled Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannibals!&#8221; cried Nell. &#8220;Marry, I should love to be a
cannibal. Are there cannibals in Jamestown, brother James? <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span> Banish me, Sire; banish me to Jamestown
of all places. Up with the sails, my merry men; give me the helm! Adair will
sail in the same good ship, I trow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair! I trow thou wert best at home, cannibal Nelly,&#8221;
determined the King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then set all the men in Britain to watch me, Sire,&#8221; said Nell;
&#8220;for, from now on, I&#8217;ll need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King shook his finger warningly at her, then leaned carelessly against
the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho there!&#8221; he cried out suddenly. &#8220;A night disturbance, a
drunken brawl, beneath our very ears! Fellow-saints, what mean my subjects from
their beds this hour of night? Their sovereign does the revelling for the realm.
James, Rochester and all, see to &#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='center'>
<p class='center'><i>The day will be so happy; for I&#8217;ve seen you at the
dawn.</i></p>
</div><!-- centered -->

<p>The room was quickly cleared, the King&#8217;s courtiers jostling one another
in their efforts to carry out the royal bidding.</p>

<p>Charles turned with a merry laugh and seized Nell in his arms almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;A subterfuge!&#8221; he cried eagerly. &#8220;Nell, quick; one
kiss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay; you question my constancy to-night,&#8221; said Nell, sadly, as
she looked into his eyes, with the look of perfect love. &#8220;You do not trust
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, sweet Nell,&#8221; protested the King, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bring me Portsmouth&#8217;s lips,&#8221; said Nell, with sad
reproof.</p>

<p>&#8220;I left her dance for you,&#8221; replied the King, drawing her closer
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At near sunrise, Sire,&#8221; sighed Nell, reprovingly, as she drew
back the curtain <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
and revealed the first gray streaks of the breaking light of day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, do not tantalize me, Nell,&#8221; besought the King, throwing
himself upon the couch. &#8220;I am sad to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s forgiving heart was touched with sympathy. Her eyes sought
his sadly beautiful face. She ran to him, fell upon her knees and kissed his
hand tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tantalize my King!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The day will be so happy;
for I&#8217;ve seen you at the dawn.&#8221; There was all the emotional fervour
and pathetic tenderness which the great composer has compressed into the
love-music of &#8220;Tristan and Isolde&#8221; in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My crown is heavy, Nell,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Heaven gives us
crowns, but not the eye to see the ending of our deeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God sees them,&#8221; said Nell. &#8220;Ah, Sire, I thank the Maker of
the world for giving a crown to one whom I respect and love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I curse it,&#8221; cried the King, with <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span> earnest eyes; &#8220;for &#8217;tis the
only barrier to our united love. It is the sparkling spider in the centre of a
great web of intrigue and infamy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me bold to speak. Cut the web, Sire, which binds thy crown to
France. There is the only danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou art wrong, Nelly, wrong!&#8221; He spoke in deep, firm accents.
&#8220;I have decided otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, his brow clouded with thought. She took his hand
tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, change your mind, Sire,&#8221; she pleaded; &#8220;for I can
prove&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, girl?&#8221; he asked eagerly, his curiosity awakened by her
manner.</p>

<p>Nell did not respond. To continue would reveal Adair, and she could not think
of that.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, I say?&#8221; again asked Charles, impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, Sire,&#8221; laughed Nell, evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, to-morrow and to-morrow!&#8221; petulantly repeated the King.</p>

<p>He was about to demand a direct reply <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_293'></a>293</span> but was stayed by the sound of a struggle
without.</p>

<p>It befell in the nick of time for Nell, as all things, indeed, in life seemed
to befall in the nick of time for her. The impious huswives shook their heads
and attributed it to the evil influence; the pious huswives asserted it was
providential; Nell herself laughingly declared it was her lucky star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, without there!&#8221; Charles cried, impatiently&#8211;almost
angrily&#8211;at the interruption. &#8220;Whence comes this noisy
riot?&#8221;</p>

<p>James, Rochester and the others unceremoniously re-entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Sire,&#8221; explained the Duke of York; &#8220;the guard
caught but now an armed ruffian prowling by the house. They report they stayed
him on suspicion of his looks and insolence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair! Adair! My life upon&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed the King, ever
ready for sport. &#8220;Set him before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>An officer of the guard departed quickly to bring in the offender. The
courtiers <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span> took up
the King&#8217;s cry most readily; and there was a general cackle of
&#8220;Adair!&#8221; &#8220;Adair!&#8221; &#8220;A trial!&#8221;
&#8220;Sire!&#8221; &#8220;Bring in the coward!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell stood in the midst of the scene, the picture of demure innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve caught Adair!&#8221; she whispered to Moll,
mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, gallants,&#8221; cried the Merry Monarch, approvingly,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll form a Court of Inquiry. This table shall be our bench, on
which we&#8217;ll hem and haw and puff and look judicial. Odsfish, we will teach
Radamanthus and Judge Jeffreys ways of terrorizing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang upon the table, which creaked somewhat beneath the royal burden,
and assumed the austere, frowning brow of worldly justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oyer, oyer</i>, all ye who have grievances&#8211;&#8221; cried the
garrulous Rochester in the husky tones of the crier, who most generally assumes
that he is the whole court and oftentimes should be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Nell,&#8221; commanded the royal judge, summoning Nell to the
bar, &#8220;thou <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
shalt be counsel for the prisoner; Adair&#8217;s life hangs upon thy skill to
outwit the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or bribe the judge, Sire?&#8221; suggested Nell, demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with thy traitor lips,&#8221; retorted Charles, with the injured
dignity of a petty justice about to commit a flash of true wit for contempt of
court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Traitor lips?&#8221; cried Nell, sadly. &#8220;By my troth, I never
kissed Adair. I confess, I tried, your Majesty; but I could not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care,&#8221; replied the King, in a tone which indicated that
the fires of suspicion still smouldered in his breast; &#8220;I am growing
jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell fell upon one knee and stretched forth her arms suppliantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair is in such a tight place, Sire, he can scarcely breathe,&#8221;
she pleaded, with the zeal of a barrister hard-working for his first fee in her
voice, &#8220;much less speak for himself. Mercy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have justice; not mercy,&#8221; replied the court, with a sly
wink at Rochester. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_296'></a>296</span> &#8220;Guilty or not guilty, wench?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not guilty, Sire! Did you ever see the man who was?&#8221;</p>

<p>The King laughed despite himself, followed by his ever-aping courtiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll plead for the Crown,&#8221; asserted the grim James, with
great vehemence, &#8220;to rid the realm of this dancing-Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast cause, brother,&#8221; laughed the King. &#8220;Rochester,
thou shalt sit by us here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rochester sprang, with a contented chuckle, into a chair on the opposite side
of the table to that upon which his Majesty was holding his mock-court and
seated himself upon its high back, so poised as not to fall. From this lofty
bench, with a queer gurgle, to say nothing of a swelling of the chest, and with
an approving glance from his Majesty, he added his mite to the all-inspiring
dignity of the revellers&#8217; court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge Rochester!&#8221; continued the King, slapping him with his
glove, across the table. &#8220;Judge&#8211;of good ale. We&#8217;ll confer with
the cups, imbibe the statutes <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_297'></a>297</span> and drink in the law. Set the rascal before
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>In obedience to the command, a man well muffled with a cloak was forced into
the room, a guard at either arm.</p>

<p>Behind them, taking advantage of the open door to appease their curiosity,
crowded many hangers-on of courtdom, among whom was Strings, who had met the
revellers some distance from the house and had returned with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold off your hands, knaves,&#8221; commanded the prisoner, who was
none other than Hart, the player, indignant at the detention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, rogue!&#8221; commanded the King. &#8220;Thy name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire!&#8221; cried Hart, throwing off his mantle and glancing for the
first time at the judge&#8217;s face. He sank immediately upon one knee, bowing
respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Hart!&#8221; cried one and all, craning their necks in surprise
and expectation.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife, a spy upon our merry-making!&#8221; exclaimed the displeased
monarch. &#8220;What means this prowling, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>&#8220;Pardon,
pardon, my reply, your Majesty,&#8221; humbly importuned the player.
&#8220;Blinded by passion, I might say that I should regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your strange behaviour and stranger looks have meaning, sir,&#8221;
cried the King, impatiently. &#8220;Out with it! These are too dangerous times
to withhold your thoughts from your King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need for commands, Sire,&#8221; entreated Hart. &#8220;The words
are trembling on my lips and will out themselves in spite of me. At
Portsmouth&#8217;s ball, an hour past, I o&#8217;erheard that fop Adair boast
to-night a midnight rendezvous here with Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nell placed her hands upon her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8211;my old friend,&#8221; she reflected sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our jest turned earnest,&#8221; cried Charles. &#8220;Well?
Well?&#8221; he questioned, in peremptory tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not believe my ears, Sire,&#8221; the prisoner continued,
faltering. &#8220;I watched to refute the lie&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;yes&#8211;&#8221; exhorted the King, in expectation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>&#8220;I cannot
go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knave, I command!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Adair enter this abode at midnight.&#8221; Hart&#8217;s head
fell, full of shame, upon his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sblood,&#8221; muttered the King, scarce mindful that his words might
be audible to those about him, &#8220;my heart stands still as if&#8217;t were
knifed. My pretty golden-head, my bonnie Nell!&#8221; He turned sharply toward
the player. &#8220;Your words are false, false, sir! Kind Heaven, they must
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Sire,&#8221; pleaded Hart; &#8220;I know not what I do or say.
Only love for Nell led me to this spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love!&#8221; cried Nell, with the irony of sadness. &#8220;Oh,
inhuman, to spy out my ways, resort to mean device, involve my honour, and call
the motive love!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are cruel, cruel, Nell,&#8221; sobbed Hart; and he turned away his
eyes. He could not look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love!&#8221; continued Nell, bitterly. &#8220;True love would come
alone, filled with gentle admonition. I pity you, friend Hart, that God has made
you thus!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>&#8220;No more,
no more!&#8221; Hart quite broke beneath the strain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dost hear, dost hear?&#8221; cried Charles, in ecstasy, deeply
affected by Nell&#8217;s exposition of true love. &#8220;Sir, you are the second
to-night to belie the dearest name in England. You shall answer well to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the lady, Sire,&#8221; pleaded Hart, in desperation.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stake my life upon her reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell?&#8211;Nell?&#8221; questioned the King; for he could scarce
refuse to accept her word when a player had placed unquestioned faith in it.</p>

<p>Nell hid her face in her silken kerchief and burst into seeming spasmodic
sobs of grief. &#8220;Sire!&#8221; was all the response the King could hear. He
trembled violently and his face grew white. He did not know that Nell&#8217;s
tears were merry laughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her tears convict her,&#8221; exclaimed Hart, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not believe it,&#8221; cried the King.</p>

<p>Nell became more hysterical. She sobbed and sobbed, as though her heart would
break, her face buried in her hands <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_301'></a>301</span> and her flying curls falling over and hiding
all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair&#8217;s sides are aching,&#8221; she chuckled, in apparent
convulsions of sorrow. &#8220;He&#8217;s laughing through Nell&#8217;s
tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Moll had been standing by the window; and, though she was watching
eagerly the exciting scene within the room, she could not fail to note the sound
of galloping horses and the rattling of a heavy coach on the roadway
without.</p>

<p>&#8220;A coach and six at break-neck speed,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;have
landed at the door. A cavalier alights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time some one arrived,&#8221; thought Nell, as she glanced at herself
in the mirror, to see that Adair was well hidden, and to arrange her curls, to
bewitch the new arrivals, whosoever they might be.</p>

<p>As the cavalier dashed up the path, in the moonlight, Moll recognized the
Duke of Buckingham, and at once announced his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ods-pitikins!&#8221; exclaimed Charles, angrily. &#8220;No leisure for
Buckingham now. We have other business.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>He had scarce
spoken, however, when Buckingham, unceremoniously and almost breathless, entered
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now?&#8221; cried the King, fiercely, as the Duke fell on his knee
before him; for his temper had been wrought to a high pitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, your Majesty,&#8221; besought his lordship, in nervous
accents. &#8220;My mission will excuse my haste and interruption. Your ear I
crave one moment. Sire, I am told Nell has to-night secreted in this house a
lover!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another one!&#8221; whispered Nell to Moll.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis hearsay,&#8221; cried the King, now at fever-heat, &#8220;the
give-and-take of gossips! I&#8217;ll none of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My witness, Sire!&#8221; answered Buckingham.</p>

<p>He turned toward the door; and there, to the astonishment of all, stood the
Duchess of Portsmouth, who had followed him from the coach, a lace mantilla,
caught up in her excitement, protecting her shapely shoulders and head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>As the assembled
courtiers looked upon the beautiful rivals, standing, as they did, face to face
before the King, and realized the situation, their faces grew grave, indeed.</p>

<p>The suspense became intense.</p>

<p>&#8220;The day of reckoning&#8217;s come,&#8221; thought Nell, as she met
with burning glances the Duchess&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak, your grace,&#8221; exhorted Buckingham. &#8220;The King attends
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, before all, my lord?&#8221; protested Portsmouth, with pretended
delicacy. &#8220;I could not do Madame Gwyn so much injustice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your speech concerns me,&#8221; observed Nell, mildly, &#8220;out
with it boldly. My friends will consider the source.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak, and quickly!&#8221; commanded Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather lose my tongue,&#8221; still protested the Duchess,
&#8220;than speak such words of any one; but my duty to your
Majesty&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No preludes,&#8221; interrupted the King; and he meant it, too. He was
done with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
trifling, and the Duchess saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My servants,&#8221; she said, with a virtuous look, &#8220;passing
this abode by chance, this very night, saw at a questionable hour a strange
cavalier entering the boudoir of Madame Gwyn!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would make my honour the price of her revenge,&#8221; thought
Nell, her eyes flashing. &#8220;She shall rue those words, or Adair&#8217;s head
and mine are one for naught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What say you to this, Nell?&#8221; asked the King, the words choking
in his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire,&#8211;I&#8211;I&#8211;&#8221; answered Nell, evasively.
&#8220;There&#8217;s some mistake or knavery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hesitates,&#8221; interpolated the Duchess, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You change colour, wench,&#8221; cried Charles, his heart, indeed,
again upon the rack. &#8220;Ho, without there! Search the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>An officer entered quickly to obey the mandate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, Sire,&#8221; exclaimed Nell, raising herself to her full height,
her hot, trembling lips compressed, her cheeks aflame. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span> &#8220;My oath, I have not seen
Adair&#8217;s face this night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words fell upon the assemblage like thunder from a June-day sky. The
King&#8217;s face brightened. The Duchess&#8217;s countenance grew pale as
death.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Adair!&#8221; she gasped in startled accents to Lord
Buckingham, attendant at her side. &#8220;Could it be he my servants saw? The
packet! Fool! Why did I give it him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckingham trembled violently. He was even more startled than Portsmouth; for
he had more to lose. England was his home and France was hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The scales are turning against us,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Throw
in this ring for safety. Nell&#8217;s gift to Adair; you understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slipped, unobserved, upon the Duchess&#8217;s finger the jewelled ring the
King had given to Almahyde among the roses at the performance of
&#8220;Granada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes! &#8217;Tis my only chance,&#8221; she answered, catching at his
meaning; for her wits were of the sharpest in intrigue and cunning, and she
possessed the boldness <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_306'></a>306</span> too to execute her plans.</p>

<p>She approached the King, with the confident air possessed by great women who
have been bred at court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty recognizes this ring?&#8221; she asked in mildest
accents.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one I gave to Nell!&#8221; answered the astonished King.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one Adair this night gave to me,&#8221; said Portsmouth,
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis false!&#8221; cried Nell, who could restrain her tongue no
longer. &#8220;I gave that ring to dear old Strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rare jewel to bestow upon a fiddler,&#8221; said the Duchess,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said Strings, who had wormed his way through the
group at mention of his name and now stood the meek central figure at the
strange hearing. &#8220;My little ones were starving, Sire; and Nell gave me the
ring&#8211;all she had. They could not eat the gold; so I sold it to the Duke of
Buckingham!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are lost,&#8221; whispered Buckingham to Portsmouth, scarce
audibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coward!&#8221; sneered the Duchess, contemptuously. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span> &#8220;I am not ready to
sail for France so soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King stood irresolute. Events had transpired so quickly that he scarce
knew what it was best to do. His troubled spirit longed for a further hearing,
while his heart demanded the ending of the scene with a peremptory word.</p>

<p>Before he could decide upon his course, the Duchess had swept across the
room, with queenly grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our hostess will pardon my eyes for wandering,&#8221; she said,
undaunted; &#8220;but her abode is filled with pleasant surprises. Sire, here is
a piece of handiwork.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knelt by the couch, and drew from under it a coat of gray, one sleeve of
which had caught her eye.</p>

<p>Nell looked at Moll with reproving glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry, &#8217;tis Strings&#8217;s, of course,&#8221; continued
Portsmouth, dangling the coat before the wondering eyes of all. &#8220;The lace,
the ruffle, becomes his complexion. He fits everything here so
beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she turned the garment slowly about, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_308'></a>308</span> she caught sight of a package of papers protruding
from its inner pocket, sealed with her own seal. For the first time, the
significance of the colour of the coat came home to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mon Dieu</i>,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Adair&#8217;s
coat.&#8211;The packet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fingers sought the papers eagerly; but Nell&#8217;s eye and hand were too
quick for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, dear Duchess,&#8221; said Nell, sweetly, passing the
little packet to his Majesty. &#8220;Our King must read these papers&#8211;and
between the lines as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of this!&#8221; commanded Charles. &#8220;What is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some papers, Sire,&#8221; said Nell, pointedly, &#8220;given for a
kiss and taken with a kiss. I have not had time to read them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some family papers, Sire,&#8221; asserted the Duchess, with assumed
indifference, &#8220;stolen from my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would have taken them from his Majesty, so great, indeed, was her
boldness; but Nell again stayed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, stolen,&#8221; said Nell, sharply; &#8220;but <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span> by the hostess
herself&#8211;from her unsuspecting, royal guest. There, Sire, stands the only
thief!&#8221; She pointed accusingly at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;My signature!&#8221; cried Charles, as he ran his eye down a
parchment. &#8220;The treaties! No more Parliaments for England. I agreed to
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree to that myself,&#8221; said Nell, roguishly.
&#8220;England&#8217;s King is too great to need Parliaments. The King should
have a confidential adviser, however&#8211;not French,&#8221; and she cast a
defiant glance at Portsmouth, &#8220;but English. Read on; read on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She placed her pretty cheek as near as possible to the King&#8217;s as she
followed the letters over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;A note to Bouillon!&#8221; he said, perusing the parchments further.
&#8220;Charles consents to the fall of Luxembourg. I did not sign all this. I
see it all: Louis&#8217;s ambition to rule the world, England&#8217;s King
debased by promises won and royal contracts made with a clever
woman&#8211;forgery mixed with truth. Sweet Heaven, what have I done!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>&#8220;The
papers have not gone, Sire,&#8221; blandly remarked Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to you, my Nell,&#8221; said Charles. He addressed Portsmouth
sharply: &#8220;Madame, your coach awaits you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Sire,&#8221; replied the Duchess, who was brave to the last,
&#8220;Madame Gwyn has yet Adair to answer for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adair will answer for himself!&#8221; cried Nell, triumphantly.</p>

<p>She threw aside the pink gown and stood as Adair before the astonished eyes
of all.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service,&#8221; she said, bowing sweetly to the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;A player&#8217;s trick!&#8221; cried Portsmouth, haughtily, as a
parting shot of contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Portsmouth,&#8221; replied Nell, still in sweetest accents,
&#8220;to show where lies the true and where the false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a witch,&#8221; hissed Portsmouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the King&#8217;s true love,&#8221; exclaimed the Merry
Monarch. &#8220;To my arms, Nell, to my arms; for you first taught me the
meaning of true love! Buckingham, you forget your courtesy. Her grace wishes to
be escorted to her coach.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;ONCE MORE YOU HAVE SAVED ME.&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>&#8220;<i>Bon
voyage</i>, madame,&#8221; said Nell, demurely, as the Duchess took
Buckingham&#8217;s arm and departed.</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s eyes fell upon the player, Hart, who was still in
custody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with this wretch!&#8221; he cried, incensed at his conduct.
&#8220;I am not done with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive him, Sire,&#8221; interceded Nell. &#8220;He took his cue from
Heaven, and good has come of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, Nell,&#8221; said the King, mercifully. Then he turned to Hart:
&#8220;You are free; but henceforth act the knave only on the stage.&#8221; Hart
bowed with shame and withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire, Sire,&#8221; exclaimed Strings, forgetting his decorum in his
eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Strings?&#8221; inquired the King, good-humouredly; for there
was now no cloud in his sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me play the exit for the villains?&#8221; he pleaded unctuously.
&#8220;The old fiddle is just bursting with tunes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>&#8220;You
shall, Strings,&#8221; replied his Majesty, &#8220;and on a Cremona. From
to-day, you lead the royal orchestra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Odsbud,&#8221; cried Strings, gleefully, &#8220;I can offer Jack Hart
an engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just retribution, Strings,&#8221; laughed Nell, happily. &#8220;Can
you do as much for Nell, and forgive her, Sire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I who should ask your pardon, Nell,&#8221; exclaimed the King,
ecstatically, throwing both arms passionately about her. &#8220;You are
Charles&#8217;s queen; you should be England&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>So the story ends, as all good stories should, in a perfect, unbroken
dream of love.</i></p>
